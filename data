1	1	Strong shareholder support – STATScontinues to be a wholly-owned subsidiary ofJCET, which is backed by SOEs, SMIC andNational IC Fund, which operate under thegovernment’s directive to strengthen China’ssemiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Wehave continued our consistent engagementnot only with the management of STATS, butalso with the management of JCET, both ofwhom we had met in China recently inSeptember 2018. We understand frommanagement that STATS remains an integralpart of JCET’s strategy as it holds the knowhowfor advanced packaging. Thus far, wecontinue to see strong support from itsultimate shareholders to STATS both in termsof investing more capital for its capex andrefinance of loans, and in terms of bridgingaccess to new Chinese customers/markets andfunding opportunities, such as through Sino ICLeasing. To date, STATS has received anaggregate US$265m of capital injection fromJCET, attesting to their strong support. JCET islisted on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with amarket capitalization of approximatelyRMB20.8b (approximately US$3.0b) as at 28September 2018. STATS current shareholdingstructure is found below.Commitment to reducing leverage – Weare of the view that there is a provencommitment to reduce leveragecomplementing the strong shareholdersupport. In 2017, JCET CFO had shared thatthey are targeting to raise another round ofequity via private placement in late 2018 forc.US$500m. To date, JCET is pending therelevant regulatory approvals as well as theapprovals of lenders of the existing syndicatedtake-out facility before it would be able toinject equity of approximately US$510m intoSTATS for the purpose of redeeming its 2020Notes, such purpose had been specificallyhighlighted to regulators as the use ofproceeds and may not be changed. Forillustration, should the bond be redeemedbefore the end of the year, the estimatedDebt/EBITDA may decrease to 1.7x, based onthe estimated FY2018 EBITDA of US$181m.Therefore, we are of the view thatshareholders would continue to lend supportto any subsequent fundraising exercises.

2	-2	Although the CFO prosecuted by Taipei Court in Aug'17 stepped down in June 2018, the litigation is still under legal process and final verdict is yet to be announced. We propose a conservative approach to further override rating to 6B.	OV_6C	DOWNGRADE
3	1	We are proposing a GLC model override and note that Senoko’s rating has traditionally been penalised by the GLC model owing to its negative tangible networth (S$2.16b of goodwill recorded on its balance sheet post-acquisition from Temasek, similar with Tuas Power and YTL PowerSeraya). CRR 8B/ ACRR 8A is a one-notch downgrade from  last year’s CRR 8B / ACRR 7B. Senoko will also be placed on Watchlist-Red for monthly monitoring (currently Watchlist-Amber) given the shorter runway to refinancing in 2019. This downgrade factors in Senoko’s lower profitability on the back of keen market competition and resultant fine retail margins.	OV_9	UPGRADE
4	1	"With conservative market outlook and based on FY17/3Q18 financial statements, EDOM is rated at CRR 7A while we propose to override EDOM’s rating to be maintained at ACRR 6B based on the following rationales:-	Industry rating benchmarking with other Taiwan semiconductor distributors (WPG rated at 4A, WTM rated at 5 and Coasia rated at 7A) given: 1)	EDOM’s market position as Taiwan's 4th largest IC distributor in terms of revenue and a niche player with exclusive product offering for iPhone series (i.e. Skyworks’ PA), and 2)	EDOM’s stable and sustainable profitability based on industry's price/ inventory protection terms on back of solid customer/vendor relationships.-	Adequate liquidity buffer as EDOM has sufficient ARP limits from several banks and enjoys 90% to 100% advance percentage. Meanwhile, EDOM receives strong credit limit support from banking community with current utilization rate of 63%. In view of most of transactions are self-liquidated basis and sufficient undrawn banking facility portion, EDOM's liquidity is considered manageable."	OV_1,OV_3D	UPGRADE

Strong financial strength and good reputation of the owner group.Cathay RED is the flagship real estate company of the Lin Yuan Group (霖園集团）, one of Taiwan's largest conglomerate by assets. The Lin Yuan Group has a controlling interest of over 54% in the company through its holdings in Cathay Life Insurance Co and Wan Pao Development Co. The group also controls Cathay Financial Holdings (2882 TT), the largest financial holding company in Taiwan.b. Strong liquidity: Backed by the close relationship with its parent, the Lin Yuan Group, its stable profitability and a conservative financial policy that preserves creditor interests over the long term, Cathay RED enjoys strong and ample credit support from bank consortiums.

11	3	We recommend an over-ride of the CRR to the ACRR of 3 based on the following: 1) Applied's longstanding position as the top provider of semiconductor capital equipment and services; 2) Applied has historically utilized relatively little debt, and they have mitigated their debt outstanding by a comparatively higher amount of cash and investment securities held at any particular point in time.  This dynamic of having a net cash and investments position has been the norm for this company for many years, and continues today; 3) The longstanding public ratings of A- by S&P (since Dec 1999) and A3 by Moody's (since April 2015).

12	1	The ICRR / CRR/ SCRR of 8C is due to the weakened financials following the recent M&A which included some one-off expenses (pls refer to financial analysis for more information). Moreover, we also understand client has paid off SGD40mil of the SGD129mil acquisition loan which was not reflected under the unaudited 9 months financials ended 30th June 2018 as the repayment was done in August 2018; hence debt level will be lower in for the full year figures ended 30th Sept 2018. Based on projected full year turnover, client is expected to report profits for full year as well and hence, we propose to upgrade rating to 8A.	OV_4B	UPGRADE

14	-1	ACRR is to be maintained at current level (6A), considering the competitive industry nature and CAL's relatively smaller operating scale compared to the large global/regional peers.	OV_9	DOWNGRADE
15	-3	ACRR has been conducted using YTD figures for the 6 month period ending June 2018.  Half year accounts do not provide detailed gross/operating cost split.  We are unable therefore to provide the correct gross profit figure and gross profit margin to compare with FYE17. This has resulted in Turnover / Working Capital financial outcome in the 90th percentile.  This would not be the position versus audited accounts where the true GP margin would be available.  In this regard propose to downgrade to current rating of 5, which is to be revisited with the benefit of full year accounts.	OV_9	DOWNGRADE
16	2	ACRR of the TBC group is proposed to be 7A, from the initial ICC 8A, based on historical 2017 and 1H 2018 financial results with non-financial inputs. We have reviewed the MRA inputs, financial ratios and scores in the GLC PD model and noticed that the initial 8A is mainly dragged down by negative tangible net worth due to goodwill assets of NT$27,984m (as of 30 Jun 2018) arising from acquisition premium. This goodwill is assessed to carry substantial value given: a. Its established leading market position as the third largest MSO with over 760 thousand subscribers, b. Strong customer relationship and penetration of its extensive network in its franchise areas. The group has a monopolistic position in the areas in which it operates. c. Proprietary technology and network (the last-mile to end subscribers) invested and developed in the broadband service offering, d. A unique business model in the highly regulated industry that has a strong EBITDA and cash generation ability, e. Strict corporate governance in testing for potential impairment for goodwill on an annual basis and the result suggests that there is sign of any potential impairment, Based on the above, we assess that these goodwill assets have enabled the group to build up a sustainable business model and steady cash flow and formed a certain level of entry barrier for brand newcomers to reach such stance and scale if they were to build up the network on their own, and therefore implying that the acquisition premium that any acquirer is willing to pay for the business on top of the fair value of the physical assets. Peer benchmarking and reference with select foreign CATV peers - Charter Communications (3rd largest in the US) and Liberty Global (No. 1 in the UK) is conducted. Even though the revenue scales of these two companies are larger given the absolute market size of US and the UK, they have similar business nature and represent similar financial profile and ratios with Taiwanese MSOs as they also have negative tangible net worth due to substantial goodwill as well as high net leverage ratios at 4.7x and 6.0x respectively. The external rating agency rating at BB+ and BB - issued by S & P provides us with reasonable reference and indication of our internal rating grid for Taiwan MSOs. We therefore propose a rating of 7A from the initial 8A.	OV_1,OV_3E	UPGRADE

22	5	The rating of Makino Asia has been negatively impacted by the GLC PD rating model given that the company recorded zero interest expense in their FY18 financials. It is understood from Group Portfolio Analytics (GPA) that the model penalizes companies with zero interest expense. The simulated ACRR assuming nominal interest expense of S$1k is 3. Makino Asia is profitable with y-o-y growth in revenue over the last 3 financial years. Financial standing of Makino Asia is strong with tangible networth of S$425m and cash holdings of S$243m as at 31 Mar 2018. The Group is deemed to be able to support their working capital requirements and capital expenditures via their own internal funds.  Given the above, we propose to adjust the rating of Makino Asia from 6B to 3.	OV_9	UPGRADE
23	-8	Propose to downgrade ACRR by 3 notches to 7B as capital structure of Texvista is adversely impacted by its investment in Vega. Investment in Vega amounts to US$7.4m as at 30/6/18 (54%) while Vega's TNW stood at US$5m, indicating a impairment of US$2.4m. Notwithstanding that, the core business of Texvista noted to be on recovery, registering higher revenue and reporting profits in FY17 and 1H18 financials. [CRM: the impact is more than US$2.4m as the entire TNW of Vega has been persistently non-existent with its string of non-paying debtors. At US$7.4m/S$8.5m, the investment in Vega is 62% of Texvista's TNW $13. 7m @ 6/2018 management account. The total liab/E ratio will deteriorate from 3x ie ($43m/$13.7m)  to 8x ie $43m/($13.7m-8.5m).

26	1	In view of the highly integrated operations, intertwined cross-shareholding structure, common management, and shared business strategy, each of the 4 Cores is considered an integral part of the group and should be rated based on the combined strengths of the group, i.e. each is to be assigned the same rating as the group. Considering the positive outlook underpinned by moderate improvement in global demand (which should help reduce oversupply in the chemical industry) and China's tightening environmental standards (which has also helped to reduce inefficient capacity and partly alleviate oversupply in the region), FPG’s strong profitability and cash flow metrics are expected to sustain, and leverage is expected to reduce steadily. We therefore consider it justified to assign ACRR 3 to the group.  This is also echoed by S&P’s recent upgrades on FPG to A- (from BBB+) on 15 Oct. 2018, which is equivalent to ACRR 3.	OV_9	UPGRADE
27	1	Based on 2016 and 3Q17 financial statements, the Borrower’s CRR is rated at 5. However, we propose to override Yulon’s rating to ACRR 4B for the following rationale:Yulon's initial CRR is based on its consolidated financials under the industry code of auto manufacturing, instead of leasing/financing. However, Yulon's consolidated base incorporates TAC (ACRR: 5), which is engaged in the auto financing/ leasing business, leading to Yulon's distorted financial ratios, especially in the financial structure (e.g. gearing, leverage and Debt/ EBITDA) and AR days, as financing/ leasing companies are used to carrying huge A/R (funded by ST loan). If we strip out TAC from Yulon's consolidated financials, its gearing, leverage and AR days would stand at much better position. To simulate the rating of Yulon’s auto manufacturing business, we’ve also run its ACRR with its 2016 standalone financials, and the result is at 2.	OV_3A,OV_6A	UPGRADE
28	1	The company registered sales improvement for 3Q2018 with NT$15.0bn (up 2.2%YoY) driven by resilient demand for Networking and Automotive sectors and 4Q sales will further improve due to peak seasonality. Per Macquarie’s report in Aug. 2018, given delay of Telecom’s order for Connected Home sector, WNC is expected to deliver sales decline to NT$55.4bn (down 2.6%YoY) in 2018 with gross margin at 12.8%. Besides, Macquarie expected WNC’s sales to show improvement in 2019 with sales of NT$62.2bn in 2019 (up 12.2%YoY) mainly driven by robust demand for Networking (i.e. enterprise AP/router, datacenter switch, up 12.2%YoY) and Automotive & Industrial (i.e. Internet of Vehicle module, Wifi combo module, up 12.2%YoY) as well as Connect Home due to delay shipments from the U.S. telecom operator to 2019. With rising sales scale and slowdown of component shortage, gross margin is expected to improve to 13.2% in 2019.  Thus we proposed to maintain Wistron Neweb's ACRR at 5 which is the same as the the rating in 2017.	OV_4C	UPGRADE

This places MDI in a good position with significant buffer to weather adverse economic conditions.2)	MDI's good financial performance - Despite a fall in top line and an increase in opex (which we understand to be one-off), MDI's performance still came in relatively healthy with NPAT of S$40.5 million (9.3%) and EBITDA of S$63.5 million (14.6%).

35	-2	As highlighted by auditor in the latest FY16 report, there is a recoverability of amount due from director and trade receivables of more than S$1Mil to be verified. This may negatively impact borrower's liquidity and if the amount is realized, a significant portion of capital will be impacted. As a small player, borrower also has limited access to alternate sources of funding. Thus Maxwill is more reflective of a rating of 7A.	OV_3D	DOWNGRADE

45	-3	The GLC PD Model initially rated Spindex an ACRR of 2. Although the Group’s latest financials indicate that its operating performance has been exemplary and that it remains financially healthy, we believe that the model fails to take into account the Group’s susceptibility to changes in the macroeconomic environment. We note that while the Group has done well to diversify its revenue across its 3 main business segments, end user demand for products in these 3 segments are highly cyclical in nature. Furthermore, as a Tier 1 / Tier 2 component manufacturer, Spindex’s position in the value chain of each of its major business segments leaves it more vulnerable to changes in market forces, compared to entities further down the value chain (eg. OEMs / brand owners).	OV_2A,OV_2B	DOWNGRADE

We propose to override rating to 8B in view of the following:1) Management showed capability in improving financing performance through a series of cost cutting measures which resulted to improvement in NPAT margin from 4.0% in FY17 to 7.2% in FY18.2) On a normalised EBITDA basis, the Debt/EBITDA was at 3.13x. With the financial covenant set at 4x, the Group has complied with the covenant. MMI's DSCR ratio as at FY18 stood at 1.40x against covenanted DSCR of 1.20x.3) Entity was largely penalised due to negative tangible netwroth as a result of goodwill arising from multiple acquisitions from the Group.4) The key management team remains intact and has been instrumental to the growth of the Group since its inception in 1989. 5) MMI has a unique and long standing relationship with lead OEMs that is not easily dislodged due to the inter dependency between MMI and its key customers like Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba.

68	4	Based on Credit Risk Rating Models guide, we found one of the model risk factors for the financial assessment is STD+LTD/Tangible Networth. Based on financial statement 30 June 2017, we found there is a significant increment of Intangible assets - toll road concession rights compare to FYE 31 December 2016 (IDR 11.1 T). The intangible asssets-toll road concesssion as of 30 June 2017 is IDR  21.6 Trillion. The significant increment of toll road concession rights is due to Waskita through its subsidiaries (WTR) acquired new several toll road sections such as Bekasi - Cawang - Kampung Melayu and Krian - Legundi - Bunder and also progress of the toll road sections which Waskita has acquired.The Company record the intangible assets-toll road based on IAS 16, thus the Company will record the progress of the toll road in:Dr. Intangible assets concession rights;Cr. Revenue from toll road construction. As such, the tangible networth will be negative since the tangible assets is less than the company's total liabilities which resulted a bad signal to the financial assessment - model risk factors. Therefore, since we did not find any decrements of financial performance compare to last year. We propose to maintain the rating as previous rating that generated in FY16.	OV_2C	UPGRADE

84	6	"AutoZone’s CRR is penalized under GLC model due to its negative TNW. We recommend overriding the Company’s rating to an ACRR of 4B, based on the following reasons:•	Aggressive financial policy, as majority of the free cash flows is used for share repurchases. The negative TNW is primarily resulted by the Company repurchasing stocks to return capital back to its shareholders. In the past three years AZO has accumulatively purchased ~$3.8Bn worth of stocks. AZO has also been retiring the stocks repurchased, thus created a retained deficit that resulted a retained deficit that led to the negative TNW. As an accounting practice, the retained deficit does not affect the Company’s ability in income generating and managing leverage. •	Committed liquidity buffer -Autozone has solid liquidity buffer with $245MM in cash on hand and $2.0Bn capacity under its revolver facility.  As discussed in Section 5- Financial Analysis, we assess that Autozone's liquidity and positive FCF generation before discretionary items are sufficient to cover the required contractual obligations. •	Debt/EBITDA - Debt Payback ratio reflects the borrower's debt repayment ability arising from cash flow generation of a going-concern. Autozone has demonstrated stable and solid Debt Payback ratio at around 2.0x over the past years. In addition, the Company reported sufficient DSCR and ISCR coverage over the past years. •	Market Leader - AutoZone has enjoyed its good competitive position as the largest operator in retail auto parts aftermarket industry with large store footprint and efficient distribution infrastructure. This has helped Autozone to achieve consistent and higher operating margins compared with industry peers.  As such, Autozone has the highest corporate ratings among the leading U.S auto retailers with solid credit profile.

Siang Hoa remains highly dependent on financial support from shareholder/director and related party (totalling $6.2m or 93% of total liabilities as at 31 Dec 2017). 4) We also note that its profitability has been fluctuating over the years.

GIC also maintained a debt free position with cash on hand well sufficient to cover 3rd parities liabilities.  If we consider the shareholder's loan as quasi-capita (ie. adjusted networth: HKD1.3 bio as of 12/2017), GIC's ACRR would be 6B with total liab/adj. networth ratio low at 0.13x.

Though UTSS' leverage is much higher than its two peers.UT's CRR of 7B is primarily due to its high consolidated gearing and negative consolidated networth as a result of the accounting treatment for the sale of assets between UT and UTSS on 29 December 2015, where the assets on UTSS' balance sheet were accorded the same NBV (S$527 million) on UT's balance sheet just prior to the sale. The difference between the purchase price and the NBV was debited to UTSS' equity under merger reserve, which was consoliated into UT's balance sheet. We have simulated ACRR of UT based on the scenario that UTSS recognised full value of assets at S$1.69 billion (estimated market valuation) to derive ACRR 4A. We propose to continue to override UT's ACRR from 7B to 7A, two notches below previous ACRR of 6A to reflect further weakening of tank storage rates in 2018 than projected as at December 2017.

We recommend maintaining ACRR of 5 based on the following rationale:•	ZBH is the largest standalone orthopedic company in the reconstructive market with revenue over $7.8Bn and benefits from its global presence with 38% of its sales •	Despite recent operating challenges the company continues to enjoy healthy EBITDA margins in excess of 30%. •	ZBH has long track record of maintaining conservative levels of debt leverage and de-leveraging its balance sheet from the incremental debt from acquisition funding. •	Its leverage (Debt/EBITDA) decreased from 5.5x as at FYE12/31/15 to 3.8x as at YTD6/30/18. We expect the Company will continue to utilize FCF to repay debt, such that its leverage will approach to ~3x by the end of 2019. •	As of 12/31/17, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (“ZBH”) had $19Bn of goodwill and intangible assets. This amount represents the Company’s estimated fair value of its trademarks and trade names, product rights, technology rights, among others.  In a distressed scenario, we assess that ZBH would be able to sell much its intellectual property at a substantial value and ZBH could realize $13.6Bn of liquidation value from its tangible and intangible assets to service its debt with the sufficient coverage of ~1.0x.•	Our ACRR of 5 compares conservatively to its S&P’s corporate rating of ‘BBB’ which equivalents to ‘4B’, and is in par with Moody’s rating of Baa3.

135	-4	The Group's improvement in ACRR from 5 (Before adjustment) in last review to 3 is largely due to improvement in turnover from S$109m in FY16 to S$163m in FY17. However, due to S$10.1m loss recognized from impairment on investment in associates (disposal of shares in associate BRC Asia Limited), as well as S$2.1m FX losses incurred for FY17, NPAT loss of of S$11.9m is incurred.

This is an “event-driven” loss, and we note that HPE’s cash flow from operations for the interim period actually increased from $504MM to $1.6BN, period over period.

154	2	"GLC model generated CRR of Abbott Laboratories at 6A (based on 1H2018 and FY2017 financials), which is two notches below the Moody’s rating of Baa1 (equivalent to DBS risk rating of 4B). We believe that the model does not take into the following considerations:•	The rating was punished by the negative TNW caused from the significant increase of intangibles. Abbott Laboratories completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical for approximately $23.6Bn, and Alere for approximately $4.5Bn in FY17. As a result, its equity stood at $31.1Bn as of FYE17 vs. $30.8Bn as of 1H18.•	Abbott performance has been benefiting from the acquisitions with a more diversified product mix and a number of new product launches. The Company is on pace to generate at least 7% organic growth in FY18, based on improving demand and positioning for its Nutrition and Diagnostic segments. Operating margin has expanded more than 200bps in the past two years, and the Company expects its margin to widen 20bps to 22% in FY18, benefited by its higher-margin device segment and improvement in diagnostics. •	Abbott has been proactively paying down debt raised for the acquisitions through its strong performance. Leverage has spiked to 4.7x by FYE17 reflecting the acquisition, by 1H18 it has dropped to 3.1x, and solid growth should enable the Company to further de-lever to under 3.0x by early FY19.  •	Moreover, Abbott’s liquidity remains solid after the acquisition, with $3.3Bn in available cash and marketable securities in 1H18, and projected FFO about $5.2Bn in FY18 and $5.7Bn in FY19, as compared to ~$2.0Bn prior to the acquisitions. By taking these into consideration, we believe, make Abbott's risk rating higher than the level of 6A and thus, 4B is the more appropriate risk rating, which is inline with the lower split rating of Baa1/BBB from Moody’s and S&P, respectively."

169	2	We have witnessed its development and performance under different ownerships, from the Taiwanese founding family to the previous sponsor, TPG, and further to current sponsor, Baring Asia.  It should be noted that the Group’s strong cash flow generation remained unchanged, supported by stable and recurring revenues without breaching covenants.  However, the two buyouts by TPG and Baring Asia in past few years substantially increased HCP Cayman’s intangible assets, which had significant negative impact on its financial structure and rating results.  In our opinion, HCP, the 2nd largest cosmetic packaging company in the world (the ex-2nd largest player, Rexam, has been acquired by the largest player, Albea), should not be classified as a Special Mention loan.   We thus recommended a rating override which was supported/approved by BU heads and all credit approvers in the credit application. With the updated Credit Risk Rating Standard and Credit Risk Rating Models Guide launched in December 2016, we followed the Model Override to upgrade the ACRR of HCP Cayman from 8B to 7B when submitting the credit memo in Mar-Apr 2017 to support the 2017 Recap Financing”.  The override reasons have been duly demonstrated in the ACRR and credit memo and approved by ECRM Monique.  According to the management reports, HCP Cayman’s P&L in 4Q17 still showed satisfactory performance with substantial growth of 21.1% in revenues and 21.2% in EBITDA compared to their counterparts in 4Q16.In the all-hands meetings conducted by BU and credit in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017, we all agreed the sustainability of its profitable business model shall be supported going forward.  Compared to the opening net leverage of 5.4x post USD55mn recap made by HCP Group in April 2017, it is still lower than 5.9x that No.1 player, Albéa, actually delivered on LTM-Sep 2017 basis.A peer comparison was also conducted to justify that HCP should be rated 2 notches above its competitor notwithstanding its high leverage.Albéa's business scale is much larger than HCP.  Due to better product mix (e.g. color cosmetics has higher gross margin than other cosmetic products owing to more advanced technology involved), HCP has better than profitability than Albéa, evidenced by the two companies’ EBITDA margin (HCP: 27-29% vs. Albéa: 11-12%).  Albéa and HCP are almost on the same level in terms of current ratio, operating cash flow generating capabilities and management effectiveness.  HCP has much longer cash conversion cycle compared to Albéa.  However, HCP has lower risk on inventory impairments and pressure derived from volatile material cost (like resin).  This is because most of HCP’s inventory is finished goods accounting for 60% (vs. Albéa’s: 44%) while raw materials only representing 19% (vs. Albéa: 45%).Regarding the financial structure, we suggest referring to the latest leverage (Net Debt to EBITDA, not the financial ratios with net worth as the denominator) in view of Albéa’s external credit rating actions, B2 assigned by Moody’s or B assigned by S&P.  According to the rating reports dated January 29, 2018, the leverage of Albéa is anticipated to be 5.9x (PIYC notes excl’d) by Moody’s or about 7x (PIYC notes incl’d, up from previous expectation of 6.0x-6.3x) by S&P which is higher than HCP’s opening leverage of 5.4x post USD55mn recap we participated in the financing in April 2017.With better profitability and lower leverage supported by positive and stable industry outlook, it should be justifiable that HCP Cayman’s ACRR is upgraded 2 notches from 8B to 7B or Albéa’s external rating at B2 or B (the equivalent of 8B upon internal classification).

We additionally note that S&P is expected to maintain a credit rating of at least BB for Microchip once the acquisition of Microsemi is completed (Microchip has been rated BB by S&P since Jan. 2016).  Based on these factors, we continue to recommend an ACRR of 6B for Microchip.	OV_9	UPGRADE

174	-3	"GLC rating model generated the initial CRR of 4A. We believe that the model does not take into the following considerations:•	Although Aircastle has continuously improved its weighted average age of its fleet, its fleet portfolio is relative older (9.1 yrs) than other competitors in the market (i.e. 5.9 yrs for ACG and 3.8 yrs for Air Lease). Thus, the company faces relatively higher asset residual risk, compared other major players.  •	Aircastle’s smaller number of aircraft in its portfolio and limited fleet diversity, when compared to leading players in the market. •	Weaker credit quality of some airline customers although Aircastle’s customer concentration is well diversified. Thus, the company faces lessee credit risk. These factors represent additional financial risk which, we believe make Aircastle’s risk rating something less than the level of “4A”. We recommend to maintain the company’s ACRR at 6A based on the following rationale:•	Solid operating trend -  Aircastle continued to report solid operating results with increased earnings, stable margins, and solid operating cash flow generation.    •	Successfully transition from secured to unsecured debt structure: - Aircastle has been successfully transitioning to unsecured debt structure from legacy secured debt structure. Total unsecured debt outstanding was $3.4Bn, which represents a percentage of total debt to 80% as of 06/31//17, same level as of 12/31/2017 and improved from 12/31/2016.  This improving trend has provided Aircastle with increased operational flexibility as well as increased financial flexibility.•	Growth in unencumbered aircraft - Of the total NBV of $6.8Bn, NBV of unencumbered aircraft was $5.4Bn, which represented almost 79% of total aircraft NBV, reflecting modest improvement from 74% of total aircraft NBV as of 12/31/17."

As per peer group comparison given in page 6 of the memo, we note that TCPL’s sales turnover is lower than Just Oil but higher than Acalpo. However, its gross and net margins are much higher than the 2 companies. The reason could be because the 3 companies are not strictly comparable as TCPL is not a pure palm oil trader. Also it offers credit period to its buyers, which helps it secure higher margins. In terms of networth TCPL is substantially larger than its competitors with over USD 36 M of TNW.Further, the ACRR of the parent of TCPL is also 7A. As such, we have aligned the ACRR of TCPL to 7A.

203	3	The ICRR of 7B is in large part driven by WDC's negative Tangible Net Worth (TNW), due to the significant amount of Goodwill and Intangible assets on its balance sheet, and WDC's $941MM off-balance sheet corporate guarantee obligation. However, we believe an ACRR of 6A more accurately reflects WDC's credit risk profile, based on the following:Leverage: WDC has a moderate leverage profile.  As of 12/30/17, Total Debt / Adj. EBITDA was 1.9x, and Debt / Capital was 52%.  Even if including the off-balance sheet obligation to Total Debt, Total Debt / Adj. EBITDA would be 2.0x, an immaterial change of 0.1x increase.Profitability: WDC is profitable on a cash basis and generates substantial amount of Free Cash Flow (FCF).  In the 6-month period ended 12/30/17, net income was -$142MM due to a $1.6BN income tax expense provision, as a result of of a one-time repatriation tax liability due to the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform.  However, $1.4BN of this tax liability has yet to be disbursed.  Further, in fiscal 2017, WDC generated FCF of $2.6BN.Liquidity: WDC has substantial liquidity resources.  As of 12/30/17, WDC had cash and equivalent of $6.3BN and undrawn RCF availability of $1.5BN.  Pro forma for Amendment No. 7, the Company will have cash and equivalent of $3.9BN, along with the undrawn RCF availability of $1.5BN.	OV_3A,OV_3B,OV_3D	UPGRADE
204	1	We deemed it is justified to rate WTM at ACRR 5 as an investment-grade company, in view of the followingconsideration: (1) Better-than-peer profitability. Given WTM's product mix is focusing on non-PC segment (i.e.smartphone, auto, industrial usage), it enjoys higher GPM than peers (i.e. WPG, Supreme, and EDOM); (2) Positivegrowing momentum and expanding market share from new line cards of Skyworks and Broadcom; and (3)Reasonable benchmark against WPG & EDOM. WPG (World's largest IC/Semiconductor distributor) and EDOM(World's 8th largest) were rated at 4A and 6B, respectively by our internal GLC model. Apart from smaller salesscale than WPG, WTM possesses consistent financial ratios representing higher profitability and similar financialposition to WPG. This warrants our judgement upgrade of WTM's ACRR to 5, to be closer toward WPG's ACRRstanding.	OV_1,OV_3B,OV_3E	UPGRADE

In the event LTA does not certify their final claim, BKPL's NPAT in 1HFY19 would be adjusted to S$631K from S$5m.  (ii) BKPL has recognised S$2.77m of investments in JV in 1HFY19 Balance Sheet which the auditor has impaired off in FY18. Assuming the worst-case scenario whereby S$4.4m of final claim is not approved by LTA and JV investments with Samsung for DTL project are impaired, adjusted networth would be eroded significantly to S$12.8m in 1HFY19.

In view of this we feel that it should be rated the same as the parent at CRR5. The justification for this is that as majority of the receivables are internal, this minimizes non payment risk. There is no debt servicing or debt repayment risk as all financing is provided by the parent. As we are extending a SCF facility to Ericsson Gmbh as one of the buying entities for the group, our payment risk and recourse will be to the parent.

We propose that the CRR of JLR Ltd be upgraded by 3 notches to ACRR 6A such that it equates to the rating of its immediate parent JLRHoldings and ultimate parent Tata Motors Limited (both currently rated at 6A) based on the following:Being the main operating company of the group, it is integral and strategic to the Group’s operations. JLR Ltd. accounted for 86% of the Group's consolidated revenues and 55% of operating profit in FY17.It is a 100% owned subsidiary of JLR Holdings and carries the reputation risk of the parent.The parent has control of JLR Ltd’s management with some of the directors of JLR Ltd. also present on the board of JLR Automotives Plc.JLR Ltd. was previously rated CRR 4A (FY16 results), however the rating assigned by GLC model based on FY17 results has slipped to CRR 7B. This could be because the TNW of the company is negative following increasedspending in product development (intangibles) and decline in operating profit margins from6.6% to 4.1% in FY17. Decline in profitability was the outcome of increased spending towards new product launches. Net worth of the Company is strong at GBP6.6Bn and on balance sheet cash was substantial at GBP4.8bn at FYE17. We remain comfortable with the company’s financials and recommend upgrade in ACRR to 6A. FYE18 financial are not available yet and are due by 31 Dec 2018.	OV_3E,OV_9	UPGRADE

232	7	As UTC is a qualified top tier WMNC and is investment grade rated by S&P and Moody's (BBB+/Baa1), we request an override in the ACRR to 4A from the CRR 8A generated by the the GLC model for the following reasons:-Strength of Brand/Patent: UTC's negative tangible net worth is primarily due to its most recent acquisition generating substantial goodwill and intangibles.  The goodwill and intangibles represent consideration of acquisition as well as patents, licenses, and brands as these intangibles continue substantial value as proven by the continued cash flow generated by these intangibles.  The various brands under the United umbrella are some of the most recognizable and valuable brands in the world resulting from its decade long dominant positions in their respective sectors.- Debt/EBITDA: Strong debt servicing capability and modest leverage is not fully reflected in the GLC model, as UTC is penalized for its negative tangible net worth.  As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt service ability appears weak when using total debt to tangible net worth as a benchmark.  However, when using total debt to EBITDA as a benchmark it reflects significantly lower risk.  Historically, UTC's leverage remained below 3.0x.  At 09/30/2018, leverage increased to 3.8x from 2.8x at 09/30/2017.  The rise in leverage was primarily due to the issuance of $11Bn of aggregate notes for the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition.  Additionally, debt service capability is strong as UTC generated ~$3.2Bn in free cash flow in YTD 3Q18.-Moody's and S&P has downgraded UTC's rating mainly due to the COL acquisition.  Our rating reflects the increase in leverage as a result of the partially debt funded acquisition of COL.		UPGRADE

Override factors are listed below for ACRR to bw 5 (CRR:8C)1. Good Acquisition Track Record & Goodwill governance in view of Thinkpad acquisitions and other smaller M&As in recent years2. Strong brand value and patents acquired from Thinkpad, Motorola and System X3. Debt-to-EBITDA is projected to be reduced to 1.1x by FY03/204.

Although KLM recorded an operating and net loss for FY2017, it was due to a one-off, non-cash expense arising from the de-risking of its pension plans. The change of two of its pension plans from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan will eliminate the fluctuations in its balance sheet (due to actuarial measurements of the pension obligations) and provide KLM with more visibility and certainty with regards to its pension obligations. Adjusting for the one-off, non-cash expense, operating profit would have been EUR771m, 12.7% higher than the FY2016 level.

This business has good growth potential and CKPL is planning to expand this across India. Hence the merger is expected to further improve the cash flows of CKPL over a period of time. o	CKPL has already pre-paid INR 1.4B (out of internal accruals) of debt and the balance NCD has been refinanced for a period of 6 years with 1year moratorium (repayment commencing from Jan 2019). Long term debt had significantly reduced from INR 5.4B in FY 17 to INR 3.9B in Dec’17.o	External rating of the company continues to be satisfactory at A/stable/A1 by CRISIL (Feb’18). The rating is after considering the above financial impact.o	No significant capex / debt is envisaged in the next 2 years and hence no further strain on cash flows. o	The Goodwill is being amortised over a period of 5 years and Trademarks over the next 10 years. This will reduce the value of intangibles Y-o-Y, coupled with increased profits would improve the TNW going forward. TNW is expected to be marginally negative at INR 13M in FY 18 and turn positive from FY  19 onwards.  o	Given its market reputation, strong business model and healthy cash generating ability, CKPL will be in a position to raise debt/equity in case of any strain on cash flows.o	Long operating history, satisfactory track record and ability to withstand competition, diversified business operations are also considered as key comforts."

257	3	ACRR of CNS is proposed to be at 6B, upgraded from initial CRR at 8A based on the 2017 historical financials with non-financial inputs.We reviewed the MRA inputs, financial ratios and scores in GLC PD model and noticed that the initial CRR 8A is mainly dragged by negative tangible net worth due to goodwill assets of NT$41,135m from acquisition premium. The goodwill is assessed to carry substantial value given:1. Its established market leader status in the industry with over 1.2mn CATV subscribers,2. Strong customer relationships and penetration of its extensive network in its franchise areas, 3. Proprietary technology and network (last mile of pipeline to retail end-subscribers) invested and developed in the broadband service,4. Unique business model in the highly regulated industry that has strong EBITDA and cash generation capability, Effectively control of 11 channels, and   5. Strict corporate governance in testing the potential impairment for goodwill on annual basis and the result suggests that there is no sign for impairment may arise.  Based on above, we assessed these goodwill assets have enabled CNS a sustainable business and steady cash flow and formed a certain level of entry barrier for brand new comers to reach such stance and scales if they were to build up the network on their own, and therefore implying the acquisition premium that the acquirer is willing to pay for the business on top of the fair value of physical assets. Peer benchmarking and reference with selected foreign CATV peers Charter Communications (3rd in the US) and Liberty Global (1st in the UK) is conducted. Even though sales scales of these two companies are larger given the absolute market size of US and UK, they have similar business nature and represent similar financial profile and ratios with TW MSOs as they have negative tangible net worth due to substantial goodwill as well as high net leverage ratio at 4.7x and 6.0x. The external agency rating at BB+ and BB- issued by S&P shall give us the reasonable reference and indication of internal rating grid for TW MSOs.  As a result, ACRR of CNS is proposed to be at 6B, upgraded from initial CRR at 8A.	OV_1,OV_9	UPGRADE

We override the ACRR to 6B given the following considerations:1.	The increase in concession rights which is booked as intangible assets is a common accounting treatment for construction companies. In HK’s case, the significant increase in concession rights was due to the following:a.	The assignment of Trans Sumatra Toll Road project with HK being the project owner. The construction progress of Trans Sumatra Toll Road will be booked in intangible assets in the form of concession rights.b.	GOI granted concession rights to JORR S Toll Road and Tanjung Priok Toll Road with HK being the toll operator, as a compensation to ‘special assignment’ from GOI to speed up the development of the ‘Trans Sumatera’ toll road project.

This is mainly due to negative tangible net worth as well as negative net worth, which arises primarily from USD 2.8bn negative merger and revaluation reserve previously recognized under UK GAAP, together with the reserve arising as a consequence of the Group’s capital reorganization in 2005 and changing the presentational currency to USD in 2008, which offsets the retained earnings of USD 1.4bn. The net worth has also decreased due to returns to shareholders and share buy-backs. The GLC rating model does not, however, take into account the continued strong performance of the Group and its good geographical and segmental diversification, its strong brand portfolio (intangibles not reflected in GLC) and fee-based, asset-light operating model, which is more resilient in times of economic downturn and limits the Group’s operating leverage and capital intensity. The Group’s market capitalisation is ~£8.8bn as at 21 February 2018.We seek approval to maintain the rating at 4B, which is in line with the rational adopted and approved in last year’s supervision review and the Group’s external credit rating from S&P (BBB/stable):o	Continued strong financial performance of the Groupo	IHG is amongst the top 3 hotel groups in the world, targeting multiple price segments with leading marking positions in many segments and a strong presence in diverse geographical marketso	IHG focuses on less capital intensive forms of hotel operation (management and franchise models) and operating costs are borne by the franchisees and as such, this is a resilient model though which the Group has managed to weather downturns in the marketo	IHG’s value is in its intangible assets – its portfolio of internationally recognized brands.

While the GLC model is the correct model to use, we are of the view that the modeldoes not appropriately assess the credit quality of the non-corporate activities of the Group, which account for approximately 14.5% of 2017 revenue and 58.7% of assets. The Group provides financing to customers toenable the purchase of Daimler vehicles, these loans to customers are financed through external debt raised mainly through the debt capital markets and financial institutions. This debt is successfully serviced by receivables from customers repaying loans to Daimler. The strength of these receivables is demonstrated by the volume of ABS transactions which Daimler has transacted in many countries around the globe in recent years.The GLC model has fully taken into account the debt levels at the Group, however, we do not believe that the model has fully captured the fact that this debt is almost fully matched by the financed receivables.The case for an upgrade is further bolstered by the fact that external rating agencies assess the credit rating of Daimler 2 notches above the GLC suggested 4B: S&P A/ Moody's A2 / Fitch A-	OV_3E	UPGRADE

However, increase in debt was only temporary, given CLC borrowed more ST debt at year-end 2017 to pile up raw material at lower price level. Coupled with CLC's early repayment of Chung Loong’s syndication outstanding in Aprl’18, the group's total debt level should normalize by 2Q18. •   Business outlook for CLC is expected to remain stable this year, given its leading position in Taiwan industrial paper market (48% market share), and improving profitability in its China operations, backed by continuous capacity consolidation and better product mix. Profitability is expected to at least remain stable, supported by solid global paper price in 2018, on top of one-off disposal gain recognition (RMB520mn or NT$2.4bn eqv.) from selling SHCL, its paper mill in Shanghai.

Although KLM recorded an operating and net loss for FY2017, it was due to a one-off, non-cash expense arising from the de-risking of its pension plans. The change of two of its pension plans from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan will eliminate the fluctuations in its balance sheet (due to actuarial measurements of the pension obligations) and provide KLM with more visibility and certainty with regards to its pension obligations.

334	4	As with last year, the GLC model returns a CRR of 6B based on the FY17 financials. This rating is adversely impacted by the fact that Meggitt has a negative TNW of c. GBP 877m (improvement over the negative GBP 1.3bn in FY16) - stemming from regular bolt-on acquisition activity, large development costs and programme participation costs - all common in the aerospace industry (eg: Airbus, one of the largest, most dominant aircraft manufacturers globally, has a negative TNW). Goodwill on the balance sheet as at FY17 was GBP 1.95bn (FY16 GBP 2.1bn). Other intangible assets include development costs (GBP 482m), programme participation costs (GBP 332m) and others (IP, software, technology, trademarks, etc) (GBP 672m).The Company's USPP issuances are assigned a rating of 2 by the NAIC which corresponds to an S&P rating of between BBB- and BBB+ (i.e. DBS 5-4A). Meggitt does not have an external corporate rating from the major ratings agencies. Liquidity is strong - the group maintains an excellent interest coverage ratio at 16x and a current ratio over 1.5x. Net debt to EBITDA remains consistent at 2.1x, within the group's stated comfortable range of 1.5x-2.5x. There are other non-financial factors positively affecting the rating but not accounted for in the GLC model, including Meggitt's competitive position, its large backlog, relatively stable revenue stream and traditionally conservative financial policy. Its primarily tier 1 supplier position on several important programmes is a significant strength. Indeed, following the Moody's methodology for the sector results in a Baa1 rating. There are other market driven factors not taken into account in the GLC model. The projected growth in civil aircraft over the next 20 years is significant,  particularly in Asia. This growth is underpinned by record order books at both Boeing and Airbus. The order books there stretch for over 10 years at current production levels. Smaller but not insignificant aircraft manufacturers are also growing, including Bombardier, Sukhoi and COMAC. The high level of demand for new aircraft is driven by sustained high fuel prices and a drive for efficiency and environmental awareness, coupled with the low cost of funding. We therefore propose to maintain the Meggitt ACRR at 4A, in line with last year.	OV_2C,OV_3B	UPGRADE

339	2	The GLC model places heavy weighting on PVH’s Tangible Net Worth, which is negative due to the amount of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet. We believe the credit standing of the Company is stronger than that depicted in the GLC’s initial CRR of 7A. Our assessment includes the Company’s success at de-leveraging in the last few years and the fact that PVH has been generating strong growth momentum. We are therefore recommending an ACRR of 6A for PVH. We note, strictly for informational purposes, our recommendation of 6A is in line with the lower split external rating of Ba1/BBB- from Moody's and S&P, respectively.	OV_3A,OV_3B	UPGRADE

To note also that PSAC's balance sheet is fairly liquid with cash holdings of SGD686m; 12% of its balance sheet. While there is no explicit support from parent, PSA International, we note that PSAC is a key integral operation of PSA Group considering that it contributes 61% and 63% to the Group's revenue and EBITDA respectively. Parental support is expected if required. On this basis, it is proposed to keep its ACRR 1 notch below its parent and also be aligned with external rating of Aa1 (Moody's).	OV_3A,OV_3D	UPGRADE

Equinix SG is free from external debt and generates healthy cashflows independently.	OV_1,OV_3A,OV_3B	DOWNGRADE
345	3	The GLC model returned a CRR based on FY17 audited financial statements of 6B, whereas external agency ratings have been stable at ‘BBB’ / 4B equivalent since 2014. The disparity is driven by negative tangible net worth reflecting the acquisitive nature of the business, and its capital light structure, as is typical in the services industry. Over half of Goodwill value relates to the U.S. pest control business. Management believe that there is material headroom between book value (the lesser of cost or value in use estimate) and value in use estimates on major balances. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and only a modest impairment charge of GBP 2.0m was incurred in FY17. We are therefore comfortable with the negative TNW position, and do not believe that the CRR provides an accurate representation of Rentokil’s credit standing. The CRR does not reflect the Group’s leading position in the Pest Control and Hygiene Service industries in the world’s largest markets, its above-average profit margins, solid cash generation ability, and conservative financial management. We seek approval for ACRR of 4B which aligns with S&P’s ‘BBB’ rating with Stable Outlook and is less aggressive than CDS score of ‘bbb+’ and Probability of Default Based rating of ‘a’.	OV_3E	UPGRADE

With the repayment of our TL in 2015, BPSB has no outstanding bank borrowings.  BPSB is in a net cash position of S$24m (after netting off its loan due to holding company).  As at 31 Dec 17, networth is relatively stable at S$161m (FY16: S$162m) and gearing improved to 0.26x (FY16: 0.29x).  After taking into account revaluation surplus on GHS, adjusted networth is S$1,003m.GCRM's comments:-To override to 5 in view of peer comparison against Frasers Property Ltd (ACRR 4A) and Hotel Properties Ltd (ACRR 4B).

The brand value of the Group has been affirmed by numerous authoritative property industry research institutions, highlighting its leading position in the industry in terms of branding advantage, product strengths and quality of service. Additional factors to support the override and rating maintenance: a) COLI has the strongest financials in addition to low repayment risk and liquidity as mentioned above. b) COLI has the strongest financing capability• Minimal subordination: secured assets or secured debt <1% of total assets or total debt• The only Chinese property developer that can issue bonds with longer tenor of 20 years.

354	-2	OSCA assigns Stora Enso a rating of 3, but Stora Enso is externally rated BB+ (stable) / Ba1 (positive) suffering still from the stigma of having some exposure to the structurally declining paper business. The main risks outlined by the rating agencies are the exposure to the cyclical paper products industry and a history of large expansion projects carrying high project and execution risks. They also note the nature of the industry being highly capital intensive and having had periods of aggressive investment for expansion in the past. What they fail to note, however, is that Stora Enso has managed its paper assets extremely efficiently constantly streamlining the cost structure, which has made the business highly cashflow generative. Stora Enso has also recently completed oneof its biggest investment projects so far in Guangxi, China. This EUR 800m investment was, however, carefully planned during a long period of time (2002-2016, with the construction taking 4 years). It was also completed on time and on budget and EBITDA break-even was reached ahead of schedule in Q4/2017. It is the largest Nordic direct investment in China and largest foreign funded project in Guangxi province and should also serve Stora Enso’s needs for a long period of time as the capacity of the board machine can be increased withoutfurther investments. According to the CEO’s statement in the latest CMD, the Group is not considering big new investments, but will be focusing on ramping-up the Guangxi plant. They also have very strict investmentdecision guidelines and ROOC targets (>20%) for any new plans. The capital intensive nature of the industry is a fact, but it also acts as a barrier to entry protecting Stora Enso’s leading market positions and Stora Enso’s plants are well maintained and efficient, which is why they have also been able to reduce their capex guidance to EUR 550-600m for 2018 compared to EUR 989m in 2015 when the Guangxi mill was still in construction phase. Maintenance capex of this is only about 50%. On the other hand, however, the rating agencies also highlight Stora Enso’s strong liquidity, balanced debt maturity profile, access to several funding sources, strengthened credit metrics due to improving profitability and cash flow generation. Business risk is seen further mitigated by strong and improving position in the relatively attractive consumer board segment (to which the Chinese investment will further contribute), where the Group supplies to large consumer goods and retail companies. They also note Stora Enso’s very large size and geographic reach, with low dependence on single mills and singleproduct segments. They also note the meaningful Finnish Government influence in terms of voting rights, but do not factor this into their ratings, despite the Finnish state investment company holding meaning that Stora Enso is categorized as a nationally important company. Taking all this into account, we propose a two notch downgrade to the OSCA rating and a rating of 4B.	OV_1,OV_3A,OV_3B,OV_3D,OV_6C	DOWNGRADE

360	4	The merger of CSC with HPE appears to be going as planned, with good integration and cost rationalization results.  However, the merger resulted in a relatively large amount of goodwill & intangibles on DXC’s balance sheet ($14.8BN, representing 44% of Total Assets) which produced negative Tangible Net Worth of $961MM at its FYE 3/31/2018.  The OSCA model is extremely sensitive to any level of negative TNW which, in this case, significantly contributes to its generation of a CRR of 7B for the Company.  Strictly for comparison purposes, we note that three public rating agencies (Standard & Poors, Moody’s and Fitch) have assigned respective ratings of BBB, Baa2 and BBB+, all of which would equate to a DBS OSCA rating of “4A” or “4B”.  Such comparison indicates the possibility that the DBS model is negatively skewed based on its interpretation of negative TNW.  Currently, we have an approved ACRR rating of “5” for DXC.  While that rating is conservatively below all three of the ratings agencies’ assessments, we continue to support an ACRR of 5 until such time as DXC can demonstrate a trend of organic Revenue growth, which appears to be one hurdle that a number of analysts are looking to see.

The negative tangible networth is primarily attributable to the significant goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of ESMHL (and the collective Target Group) by Capital Square Partners in November 2017. Accordingly, we have assessed the CRR on the basis of a reclassification of 50% of acquisition goodwill as other assets which resulted in a positive tangible networth of ~US$12.2 million.

These intangibleassets covers valuation of patents, productlicensing arrangement and other proprietaryintellectual property rights relating to productinnovation.

Post-acquisition, the blended EBITDAmargin of the combined group is expected tobe ~32% due to Shire’s high margins drivenby its rare disease portfolio and exposure tothe US market (see financial projections)o Takeda’s Debt/EBITDA of 3.3x vis-à-visAstraZeneca’s 3.8x with the latter rated BBB+(eqv.

373	3	Compared to FY2016, we noted that YEA's financial performance have improved. Company has noted to have significant amount of cash on hand with no debt reported. In addition, we noted that the model penalizes the rating a company where no interest expense is incurred. The inclusive of interest expense generated a CRR of 3. However, as the parent Co YEC is rated 4B, we are proposing to align the ACRR to 5, 1 notch below the parent due to presence of interco sales.	OV_9	UPGRADE
374	2	The CRR generated by our OSCA model is 6B, which is based largely on the model's assessment of the Company's proforma leverage.  OSCA assesses Leverage based on the ratio of Debt/Tangible Net worth, and the resulting ratio for Broadcom falls into the 10th percentile (the worst category available within the model), due to the Company's negative TNW.  A more traditional assessment of leverage, based on the ratio of Debt/Adjusted EBITDA, indicates pro forma leverage of 3x for Broadcom, which is not unusually high for a semiconductor company in today's rapidly consolidating market.  If we compare Broadcom's Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x to that of Qualcomm (a large peer semiconductor company, whose leverage ratio is near 3.5x), we can see a comparably more favorable leverage profile for Broadcom.  Qualcomm's ACRR of 3 also takes into consideration that company's large cash balance which outweighs its balance of Total Debt.  Nonetheless, based strictly on a comparison of the two companies' leverage ratios, we believe there is justification to recommend an ACRR of 5 for Broadcom.  We also note, strictly for informational purposes, that Broadcom's current public ratings [BBB- (Stable) by S&P and Baa2 (Negative Watch) by Moody's] are relatively close to our recommended ACRR rating of 5.

With a book equity value of $17.7 billion, this renders the TNW negative. However, this is not uncommon for large U.S. technology companies, as the industry continues to consolidate. We believe an override to an ACRR of 3 is justified based on the following:• Leverage - IBM has a moderate leverage profile, with Total Debt / Adj. EBITDA and Net Debt / Adj. EBITDA of 2.7x and 2.0x, respectively, as of 12/31/17. • Profitability - IBM has consistently been profitable and generated substantial Adj. EBITDA and NPAT. In 2017, IBM generated Adj. EBITDA and NPAT of $17.1Bn and $5.8Bn, respectively.  NPAT was lower than previous years mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which resulted in the Company recognizing a one-time charge of $5.5Bn in FY17.• Liquidity - As of 3/31/18, the Company had ample liquidity of $28.1Bn, including cash and marketable securities of $12.8Bn and undrawn existing and proposed revolvers.• Management - IBM has a highly regarded management team with significant years of experience in the technology industry.

During the year, YHSL also sold its shares in Super and received cash of ~S$67m. BENCHMARKINGYHS is most comparable to F&N among the comparable universe given its similar ASEAN F&B footprint. The remaining F&B players (source: F&B Industry team) are not directly comparable as they are either global/domestic players or competes in a different beverage class. Therefore, our analysis is focused against F&N beverage segment (note: F&N’s business include publishing). Analysis: F&N has a higher F&B revenue of US$1.2b. Nevertheless, we noted that bulk of the contribution is derived from diary products. The beverage revenue accounted for US$431m of revenue versus YHS’s turnover of US$293m. In terms of profitability, YHS has a higher EBITDA margin of 12% versus F&N’s beverage margin of 7%. In terms of balance sheet strength, YHS has no bank debt with cash at bank of US$66m. It also has a higher asset base of US$556m (F&N beverage assets:US$262m) Recommendation: Given the aforementioned, we are proposing to rate YHS ACRR 3 (existing ACRR is 5 under GLC) based on benchmarking.

425	4	Slater's consolidated turnover for FY17 (ending 30 Jun 17) is US$902.9m. We are proposing to override the rating in view of the group's debt servicing ability, balance sheet strength, and liquidity. Slater's net debt to EBITDA was 4.0x as at 30 Jun 17. Slater's turnover is dependent on the performance of Interplex Holdings Pte Ltd (IHL), and IHL has demonstrated its ability to generate cash flow from operations to service its debt since the first acquisition debt was taken in 2007.  As at 30 Jun 17, current ratio of 1.4x, ISCR of 3.4x and DSCR of 2.1x can be considered satisfactory. Gross debt/EBITDA of 5.0x (net debt/EBITDA of 4.0x) remains on the high end, considering that this is only the first full year after the acquisition and that EBITDA did not improve significantly during the year due to flattish revenue in FY17. Further, while Slater has US$270.8m of share capital, there is substantial intangible assets due to goodwill arising from the acquisition of IHL by BPEA, resulting in negative tangible net worth of US$1.6m as at 30 Jun 17, hence the poor ICRR rating of 8C. However, Slater and IHL are expected to be disciplined in amortising the cost of these intangibles (note that the tangible net worth as at 30 Jun 17 is a smaller absolute figure compared to the negative US$13.6m as at 30 Jun 16). Slater has also secured committed funding via the syndicated facilities which ensure that the overall Group has a steady liquidity source.	OV_9	UPGRADE

Although there is an  improvement in its gearing from 3.26x to 3.01x from FY2016 to FY2017, which is considered high when we bench-mark against other contractors in our portfolio.  This is mainly due to high trade payables and billings in excess of WIP which is normal in the construction industry as well as the bank debt taken up during the year to fund its maiden residential development project of the Group.

Financial performance of CRRC remained strong with total revenue of RMB211bn and NPAT of RMB13bn in FY2017.  It also has a strong cash position with unrestricted cash balance of over RMB56bn.  In FYE2017, the Debt / EBITDA and Net Debt / EBITDA ratios are satisfactory at 3.0x and 0.5x respectively.  Meanwhile, DSCR and ISCR are strong at 2.9x and 12.0x.-	Strong liquidity support from banks. As of 31Dec2017, CRRC has been granted credit facility of RMB220bn, of which RMB184bn has not been utilized.  CRRC, due to its dominant market position and solid financial profile, has been receiving strong supports from the banking communities including local banks (Big Five, CDB, EXIM Bank, CITIC Bank, etc.) and foreign banks (HSBC, SCB, SocGen, Citibank, etc.).-	Strength of Brand/Patent. As the dominant player in China’s rolling stock industry, CRRC has accumulated a wealth of practical experience amid the boom in this country’s construction of railways, especially High-Speed Railway (“HSR”).  Going forward, China’s massive construction plan for HSR (5,000 km to be built from 2018 to 2020) will help CRRC maintain its competitive edge on project experience over international peers.  As of FYE2017, its domestic products have accounted for more than 80% of all parts.  The core technology of lightweight bodies, bogies, traction control systems and network control systems achieved self-supply. In addition, CRRC’s Alpine technology for Electric Multiple Units (“EMU”) leads the world.  •	Benchmarking DBS internal rating to the company’s external rating and its peers in the market -	ICRR generated for one of CRRC’s peers, Bombardier Transportation (Global Holding) UK Limited (“BT Holding”), was 4A based on FY2017 financials. CRRC was rated at 5 mainly due to longer AR days of 163 days in MRA (vs. BT Holding’s 40 days attributed to factoring transactions).   After benchmarking CRRC with BT Holding, we found CRRC outperformed BT Holding in terms of revenue scales, profitability, leverage and cash position. Please refer details to below table and ACRR reports as attached:Item	CRRC	BT HoldingRevenue	RMB211B	RMB59BProfitability (NPAT attributable to the owners / Revenue)	5.1%	0.6%Leverage (total liabilities / total assets)	0.62x	0.88xCash 	RMB61B	RMB8BEUR/RMB: 7.79 @ 31Dec2017-	Holding strong market position in global railway equipment industry with satisfactory revenue / profitability, healthy cash generation ability and low leverage, CRRC is one of the highest rated international railway equipment manufacturer compared with its peers.

435	-3	The final proposed ACRR is notched down from GLC rating of 4A on account of subdued standalone financial performance (negative operating profitability) and leakages in upstreaming the cash from Hindustan Zinc Limited (based on its 64.9% shareholding in HZL). However, it is proposed to be upgraded to 6A from 6B given the merger with Cairn India resulting in better financials, positive credit rating movements (CRISIL has revised its outlook from AA/Stable to AA/Stable in Apr17), merger of Vedanta Ltd and Cairn India, PSC extension on Cairn's Rajasthan block till 2030 and special dividends declared by subsidiary Hindustan Zinc to the tune of INR 120 Bio (which translates to INR 65 Bio at Vedanta Ltd) in Apr 2016 and INR 140 Bio (corresponding to INR 78 Bio at Vedanta Ltd.) in Mar 2017. It may be noted that the proposed rating for Vedanta Limited is better than its parent, Vedanta Resources (VRPlc, ACRR - 7A). Vedanta Limited is the flagship operating entity of the Group with its own cash-flows being utilized to service its own debt. VRPlc being a holding company relies on the dividend to be up-streamed through its operating subsidiaries such as Vedanta Limited to service its own obligations which results in its own debt getting subordinated.

In 2017, COLI represents more than 77% of COHL’s asset, revenue. Rest of it mainly from China State Construction International Holdings Limited (“CS’ Intl); • COHL’s consolidated net gearing is at 0.41x with gearing healthy at 0.87x in FY17; Net profit margin is high at around 22%; • COHL’s liquidity is also satisfactory with current ratio > 2x and cash to short term debt of ~3.1x. The Company has good access of liquidity from bank loans and capital market both onshore and offshore (evidenced by low pricing and chunky size of its syn/club loan). 2) COHL’s indicative A- rating from DBS rating advisory • Both CS China and COLI is A rating, so this COHL is the key connection (bridge in between) which should be A- rating logically; We consulted our rating advisory team who verbally advised that should COHL seeks rating, it is highly likely to be rated at least A- (reference to ACRR 3) given the substantial financial contribution fromCOLI, satisfactory standalone debt servicing, strategic importance to the Group and an inevitable integrated part of CS China; • According to Fitch, “MOHURD” (住建部) views CS China and COLI as an integrated entifity with construction and homebuilding expertise to execute the ministry’s policies and objectives”. Part of the strategic role CS China plays in the field of housing construction is due to the ownership of COLI through COHL. Without COHL, the Group cannot integrate any of its offshore subsidiaries into the Group; • Rating agency also applied one notch up for COLI’s rating given its SOE background and importance to the Group. We think it is fair to upgrade one notch of COHL’s ACRR from 4A to 3 (same as COLI) in view of the above and reference to the A- rating of rating agencies. 3) Same management team with strong track record and risk management capabilities • Some of the senior management in COLI (including Chairmen and CEO Mr. Yan Jianguo) are also the board members of COHL, with strong management track record in the construction and property development field; • COHL is 100% owned by CS China, which was ultimately ownd by central SASAC, and there is high reputational risk of the government if COHL runs into financial distress; •COHL also shares the same brand name “China Overseas” of COLI and hence the “strength of brand” also applies.

The ACRR of 4B is derived based on a two-pronged approach:-a.	reclassification of 50% of its acquisition goodwill and intangible assets to other non-current assets; andb.	peer comparison to other players operating in the same industry (two notches below Telstra which is rated ACRR 3).  The basis for the reclassification of a portion of its goodwill is as follows:a. Enhanced market leadershipb. critical and scarce spectrum assetsc. indefeasible rights of use of capacity d. proper corporate governance Upon reclassifying 100% and 50% of goodwill and intangible assets to non-current assets, the resulting CRR was 4A. We recommend a CRR of 4B to TPG in order to be comparable to its peers such as Telstra which has been rated ACRR 3.a.	While Telstra is significantly larger than TPG across revenue, EBITDA, net income and market cap, TPG is able to achieve high profitability (refer to Exhibit 10 Industry Analysis) comparable to that of Telstra, thanks to TPG’s no-frills low-cost operating model. Despite a considerably smaller business scale compared to Telstra, TPG is a cost leader in the regional telecom market.b.	Weighing the above factors against the less leveraged position of TPG (LTM Gross Debt/ EBITDA basis as of 1st Jun 2018, 1.1x for TPG and 1.9x for Telstra) and its smaller size, we are of the view that a two-notch downgrade from Telstra’s rating can be reasonably justified."

In recent years, the Group’s gearing has been around 30-40% and they even have an internal target to keep the ratio at below 50%. Even though the Schuldschein doesn’t include a monitoring covenant, the documentation does ensure that in a default scenario the Schuldschein lenders would be on an equal standing with the RCF lenders:a)	it states that the payment obligations under the Schuldschein rank pari passu with the claims of all its other unsecured creditors, andb)	the cross-default threshold of EUR 20m would capture any defaults under the RCF (or bonds) andc)	it is also a default under the Schuldschein if the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties commences negotiations with one or more of its creditors with a view of rescheduling any of its indebtedness (effectively cross acceleration, which gives Schuldschein lenders the benefit of the default provisions in the RCF) andd)	if any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution affects any asset of the Borrower or assets of any Material Subsidiary exceeding EUR 10m in value (unless disputed in good faith).In order to reflect the fact that the Schuldschein doesn’t have a monitoring covenant, we propose to downgrade the rating of the Group from 4A to 4B."

487	3	We ran a simulation to reclassify TUC’s intangible assets which consist mainly of 3G and 4G spectrum licenses, for the historical period FY14 to FY17 as they have real value for the business. Spectrum is a critical asset of the company which is needed in order to provide its telecommunications services. The spectrum enhances the company’s network capacity and efficiency and helps tap significant growth in data, provide better network coverage and service quality. Further, the cost of spectrum which was paidby the company had been derived following an auction process conducted by Thailand’s telecoms regulator and is therefore market determined. Accordingly, there is good basis for the aforementioned spectrum licenses to be re-classified as tangible assets.This simulation provided a SCRR of 6B but we propose to retain our previous ACRR  rating of 7A. Comparing against DBS base case projections back in September 2017, TUC actual performance fared better for revenue, EBITDA and net income figures. In view of higher working capital requirements, TUC’s cash is lower than our projections. Thus, FY17 net Debt/EBTIDA of 1.8x and adjusted net debt/EBITDA (including vendor financing) of 3.6x are marginally higher than the projected 1.5x and 3.3x respectively. Notwithstanding the slightly higher leverage, these leverage ratios remains acceptable. Given that there was no material change from back in Sep 2017 when we proposed the previous ACRR of 7A, we wish to retain that rating as opposed to bumping it up to 6B.	OV_3E	UPGRADE

500	4	As MCD is an investment grade entity rated by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, we request an override to an ACRR of 4A from a CRR of 6B generated by the GLC model. MCD's negative tangible net worth is primarily due to share repurchases. However, the company continues to generate substantial free cash flow with a strong balance sheet.  We request an approval for ACRR override from 6B to 4A based on the following reasons:1. Committed liquidity buffer – There is a sizable committed liquidity buffer as MCD had $2.6Bn of cash and equivalent and $2.5Bn of capacity under its undrawn revolver. We assess that MCD’s liquidity and positive FCF generation before discretionary items are sufficient to cover the required contractual obligations. 2. Debt/EBITDA - Debt to EBITDA continues to remain lower than its peers at 3.2x, which is significantly lower than the industry average of similarly sized peers in the QSR space at 4.8x. Adj. Debt (Debt+6xRent) to EBITDAR was also significantly lower than its peers at 3.5x with the industry average being 4.8x3. Strength of Brand/Market Leader – According to Financial Times and WPP advertising group, MCD is the most valuable fast food brands in the world with an estimated brand value of about USD 126 Bn and ranked No. 8 on the Top 100 global brands in 2018. MCD is also the leading QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) chain in the U.S and an industry leader in many international market.	OV_3A,OV_3B,OV_3D,OV_9	UPGRADE
501	3	The GLC model appears to be weighting heavily the fact that the ProForma Company has significant goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet.  Such phenomenon (high levels of intangible assets) is relatively status quo for companies that compete in the telecommunications industry, and the public ratings agencies' ratings reflect the belief that these assets carry significant value in the marketplace.  Currently, we note that the public ratings for stand-alone AT&T are BBB+ (S&P) and Baa1 (Moody's), with both agencies having their ratings on Negative Watch for likely downgrade once the acquisition of Time Warner closes.  These facts, along with our assessment of AT&T's longevity and top standing in the telecommunications industry, leads us to recommend an ACRR of 4B.	OV_9	UPGRADE

505	7	HON is a Qualified Top Tier WMNC and is investment-grade rated by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch (A/A2/A), we request an override in the ACRR to “3” from the CRR “7B” generated by the GLC model for the following reasons:• Debt/EBITDA. Strong debt servicing capability and modest leverage is not fully reflected in the GLC model, as HON is penalized for its negative tangible net worth. As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt payback appears weak when using Total Debt/Tangible Net Worth as benchmark. However, using Debt/EBITDA as a benchmark reflects meaningfully lower risk, at only 2.2x Debt/EBITDA at 12/31/2017. Additionally, debt servicing capability is strong, as Honeywell generated cash from operations of over $6.0Bn in FY17 with an average of $5.4Bn over the last 3 years. We view the low leverage and strong cash flow generation as indicative of a “3” rating.• Strength of Brand/Patent. Honeywell’s negative tangible net worth is primarily due to its substantial goodwill and intangibles. These goodwill and intangibles represent acquisitions as well as patents, licenses and brands which continue to have substantial value as proven by the continued cash flow generated by the various segments of the Company.• At 12/31/2017 HON had a cash balance of $10.8Bn, an increase of $1.5Bn from 12/31/2016. In addition, liquidity is enhanced as HON has $4.0Bn available under its Term Revolver and $1.5Bn under its 364-Day Revolver.	OV_3A,OV_3B,OV_3D,OV_3E	UPGRADE

In a recent meeting with DBS Group CEO, Adi Godrej (Chairman Emeritus) clearly mentioned that the Group has and will continue to support all its businesses and there has been no instance of any Group company being let down. Post Balance-sheet events - GIL’s subsidiary – Godrej Agrovet Limited (GAL) listed on the stock exchange in Oct’17, via an IPO of ~INR 11.6B. Of the IPO proceeds, GIL and GAL have received ~INR 3.0B each in FY18, with the remaining portion being paid to the other key stake holder- Temasek Holdings Pte.Balance sheet investments - On a consolidated basis, GIL’s business profile is diversified, backed by a large investment portfolio comprising of investments in subsidiaries, group companies and companies outside the Group. Over the years, GIL has not only demonstrated the ability to monetize these investments but also incubate new business. It should be noted that as of 31st Dec’17, the market value of GIL’s investment in GCPL, GAL and GPL stood at INR 182.5B, providing a cover of 6.4x over GIL’s standalone debt of INR 28.6B as on 31st Mar’17.

GLC override guidance, the GLC output for GCPL can be overridden based on the following factor - Other Additional Reasons – Strength of Brand / Good Acquisition Track Record & Goodwill Governance.GCPL has significant goodwill (on consolidation) on its balance sheet aggregating to ~INR 47.2B (as on 31st March’18), attributable to number of global acquisitions (Megasari Group in 2010, Darling Group in 2011 – 14, etc.) done in the past. On standalone basis, the company has a positive TNW of INR 38B.  These global acquisitions have been synergistic in terms of supply chain efficiencies, product cross-pollinations and stronger distribution network, besides diversifying GCPL’s product portfolio and geographical reach. The acquisitions have not only added new businesses to GCPL’s consolidated business profile, but also have a significant bearing on GCPL’s consolidated performance of the company, given their sizeable scale individually. It should be noted that the international business contributed ~47% to the total consolidated revenues for FY18, with Africa (including SON) contributing ~47% of the international sales.GCPL’s intangible assets (including goodwill) are tested for impairments by the auditors on an annual basis and the company has a track record of timely recognition of any goodwill impairment.

In view of the above – our risk of a potential acceleration of our Bank’s exposure under a cross default has been eliminated.3)	It is noted that CRR 8C is predominantly triggered by the disclaimer of opinion issued against their financial statement since FY16. The opinions was with reference to the Company’s adoption of the going concern assumption – as they was insufficient evidence to support the Company’s ability to service their pre-existing debt obligation mainly the impending Notes maturity due Oct 2018.  Though as mentioned above, this has been mitigated as AusGroup have obtained approval for extension by 4 years – with downsizing of Notes obligation to approx. S$49m (from S$73m) thru partial repayment and Notes equity swap. Thus leverage proxied by Debt / EBITDA shall be manageable below 2.0x upon completion of the CSE."	OV_3B,OV_5B	UPGRADE

We believe that an override for Paccar is warranted due to the following override factors:a. Low historical loss rate in the Receivable portfolio – Paccar, which has demonstrated good track record in managing its in-house financial arm, maintains a low charge off rate, well capitalized financial subs, and has shown to release cash flow in times of market contractions. b. Debt to Ebitda – Paccar’s manufacturing operations maintain zero debt, and on a consolidated basis, the Debt/EBITDA of 2.6x compares favorably to the peer group.c.

We believe that the model does not take into the following considerations: -.•	Risks related to being new independent company- Prior to the separation, PayPal has been operated by eBay as part of its broader organization, and has shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. PayPal, as an independent company, may lose certain of the synergies and benefits enjoyed as a result of being part of eBay.This represents additional financial risks which, we believe, make PayPal’s risk rating less than the level of “3”. We recommend a ACRR of 4A, which is one-notch upgrade from our previous rating of 4B, based on the following justification: •	The Company continued to deliver solid performance in FY2017, with total payment volumes up 27.4% in FY2017 YoY and revenues up 20.8%. •	In the agreement PayPal entered with Synchrony in November 2017, the Company is selling its $5.9Bn U.S retail loan book to Synchrony, at par. The transaction is expected to substantially decrease PayPal’s aggregate credit risk by free up about $1Bn of cash flow every year that would otherwise have been devoted by the Company to fund the loan book. Management also guided to over $4.5Bn in free cash flow in FY2018.•	PayPal has been maintaining a lower-risk balance sheet position in a highly competitive payments space.

According to the guidance from management team, Delta's revenue growth will mainly be supported by the industrial automation (IA) and infrastructure segments, which are expected to grow to together contribute 65-70% of the total sales in 5 years (vs. 48% in 2017).  Currently, half of Delta's IA sales come from Chinese market, where IA will remain a megatrend, supported by government policy and increasing labour cost.   It is expected by the management team that Delta will report double-digit sales growth in 2018; and- Delta's strong debt serving capability, evidenced by the low total debt/ EBITDA ratio of 0.84x as of FYE2017.

524	2	Based on FY16 and FY17 consolidated financials, the GLC model has assigned VW AG with a CRR of 5. This rating however, is constrained by the leverage profile of the group which had deteriorated in FY15 because of lower earnings following the diesel emissions issue. However, FY16 and FY17 results show that VW the Diesel issue is a thing of the past with the Group reporting an operating profit of EUR13.8bn. Leverage has also improved to 5.53x at FYE17 (7.2x at FYE15). General guidance is that the strong performance of FY17 will continue in the next few years (2018-19), supported by Group’s leading market position, balanced geographic diversity and its strong competitive position with a diverse product range of well-known brands. In view of this, we recommend that the CRR of the Group be upgraded by two notches to ACRR 4A. Our case for an upgrade to ACRR 4A is also strengthened by the external ratings assigned to VW. Moody’s has rated VW AG at A3 (which equates to ACRR 3), whereas S&P rates the Group at BBB+ (ACRR4A). VW AG’s existing rating based on FY15-16 results is ACRR4A, so in effect there is no impact on rating.	OV_3A	UPGRADE

KMC is majority owned by its parent (KCL):KMC is 51% owned by Keppel InfrastructureTrust (“KIT”) and 49% owned by KeppelEnergy, a wholly - owned subsidiary of KCL.Given KCL’s 18.3% ownership of KIT, KCL isKMC’s ultimate parent company with a totalownership of 58%;2.

Given the importance of the brands, they are considered to have significant, long-term  value and would be expected to retain such brand value if required. Intangible assets are tested for impairment regularly to ensure that the book value does not exceed the value in use - no impairments were made in the past 2 years.

As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt payback appear weak when using Total Debt/Tangible Net Worth as a benchmark.  Additionally, debt servicing capability is strong, with a ISCR of 41.4x as of 04/01/2018.•  Strength of Brand/Patent - GD’s negative tangible net worth is primarily due to its substantial goodwill and intangibles. These goodwill and intangibles represent acquisitions as well as patents, licenses and brands which continue to have substantial value as proven by the continued cash flow generated by the various segments of the Company. •  Committed liquidity buffer - In addition to cash of $4.3Bn as of 4/01/18, GD’s liquidity position is enhanced by the $5.0Bn of availability on its committed revolving credit facilities.•  The proposed ACRR at 3 is in line with the previously approved ACRR.

564	1	• GLC rating model rates FMC on consolidated basis including its captive finance business. Due to consolidated basis rating, FMC is penalized for large portion of debt hold at its captive finance company, FMCC.o Of $154.3Bn consolidated debt, its debt associated with FMCC represents 89.7% (or $138.4Bn) while automotive debt represents 10.3% (or $15.9Bn) only.o Its close competitor, General Motors Co. (“GM”) is another auto manufacturer borrower in our portfolio which has risk rating of ACRR 4B. GM’s captive finance business (“GM Financial”) is relatively smaller compared to FMCC, thus, carries substantially lower debt and lower balance sheet leverage which GM has benefited for one-notch higher rating than FMC in the GLC rating model.o Based only on the automotive debt, FMC’s net leverage (including Pension & OPEB) remained low at 0.6x at 12/31/2017. • Besides its debt and leverage comparison, FMC compares well with GM on key operating measures for FY17 and liquidity position at FY17.o We note our proposed ACRR of 4B is in line with upgraded ratings of BBB/Baa2 by S&P/Moody's.

569	2	Based on 2017 financials GLC assigns IHC Merwede Holding a rating of 7B, a one notch upgrade on the 8A assigned on 2016 financials. We do not believe this new rating correctly reflects the Group’s current credit standing given the rating factors external to the GLC model, some of which are listed above, and including: 1) state support for work in progress (via guarantees); 2) IHC Merwede being granted “Royal” status within the Netherlands confirming that the business is of key status to the Dutch state; 3) access to a core facility which can adapt to the working capital needs of the business (greater comfort than just a 'supportive banking group' as per NF3: access to funding in the Non Financial element of the GLC model) ; 4) the positive forward looking financial profile and high level of transparency over the order book. Due to the factors above providing strong upside to the backward looking GLC model, we propose a rating of ACRR 6B, in line with the 6B assigned on the 2016 financial statements.

572	3	ACRR of the TBC group is proposed to be 7A, from the initial ICC 8A, based on historical 2017 and 1H 2018 financial results with non-financial inputs. We have reviewed the MRA inputs, financial ratios and scores in the GLC PD model and noticed that the initial 8A is mainly dragged down by negative tangible net worth due to goodwill assets of NT$27,984m (as of 30 Jun 2018) arising from acquisition premium. This goodwill is assessed to carry substantial value given: a. Its established leading market position as the third largest MSO with over 760 thousand subscribers, b. Strong customer relationship and penetration of its extensive network in its franchise areas. The group has a monopolistic position in the areas in which it operates. c. Proprietary technology and network (the last-mile to end subscribers) invested and developed in the broadband service offering, d. A unique business model in the highly regulated industry that has a strong EBITDA and cash generation ability, e. Strict corporate governance in testing for potential impairment for goodwill on an annual basis and the result suggests that there is sign of any potential impairment, Based on the above, we assess that these goodwill assets have enabled the group to build up a sustainable business model and steady cash flow and formed a certain level of entry barrier for brand newcomers to reach such stance and scale if they were to build up the network on their own, and therefore implying that the acquisition premium that any acquirer is willing to pay for the business on top of the fair value of the physical assets. Peer benchmarking and reference with select foreign CATV peers - Charter Communications (3rd largest in the US) and Liberty Global (No. 1 in the UK) is conducted. Even though the revenue scales of these two companies are larger given the absolute market size of US and the UK, they have similar business nature and represent similar financial profile and ratios with Taiwanese MSOs as they also have negative tangible net worth due to substantial goodwill as well as high net leverage ratios at 4.7x and 6.0x respectively. The external rating agency rating at BB+ and BB - issued by S & P provides us with reasonable reference and indication of our internal rating grid for Taiwan MSOs. We therefore propose a rating of 7A from the initial 8A.	OV_1,OV_3E	UPGRADE

598	8	We propose an override of CG's ACRR from 8B to 4A, based on the following key considerations: 1. Conventional financial credit metrics are not fully applicable to the business trust structure. For FY2017, the capital structure of CG comprises bank debt (S$178m), and Qualifying Project Debt Securities (QPDS, S$196m). CG structured as a business trust and hence is able to make distributions to its unitholders in excess of its net profit after tax or even when it records a loss after tax, so long as the distributions are supported by operating cashflow. This suggests that a typical business trust is unlikely to have significant retained earnings which will adversely impact its tangible networth position. In addition, it is not uncommon for business trusts to show accounting losses and negative networth due to: (i) structuring to optimize tax efficiency e.g. using tax deductible instruments such as QPDS as quasi-equity in the capital structure; and (ii) noncash depreciation associated with infrastructure assets (which are typically capital intensive). While the net loss or negative networth position will not affect CG's ability to pay distribution and service its debt, the GLC model penalizes the CRR of CG, mainly due to the negative networth of S$52m for FY2017. As the QPDS are unsecured and subordinated to our bank loan (i.e. nonredeemable unless the bank loan is repaid), we treat them as quasi-equity and if we include them in CG's net worth calculations, its net worth would be positive at S$144m instead. 2. CG's monopolistic position in town gas coupled with the fact that its nature of business is of strategic importance to Singapore shelter it from competitive pressures and are also key rating considerations. CG operates in a regulated tariff regime with EMA as the regulator. Over the past years, EMA has consistently approved tariff revisions to align to fuel cost fluctuations, albeit with some short - term time lag in implementation. Given the strategic importance of City Gas, we expect such strong market fundamentals to continue. 3. SP Services (100% owned by Temasek) an entity operating in a similarly  regulated industry, with a substantially monopolistic position in electricity retail business (liberalisation of electricity retail market is planned to be rolled out islandwide at end 2018) and of strategic importance to Singapore is currently rated CRR/ACRR 2. Adopting this rating as a benchmark, we propose to rate CG 2 notches below SP Services at 4A in consideration of: (i) the higher gearing at CG; (ii) the smaller indirect stake held by Temasek through Keppel; and (iii) CG's smaller scale of operations vis-a-vis SP Services. Note: Approval for a model override from 8A/B to 4A has been obtained annually since CG was first rated under the GLC PD model in Feb 2013.	OV_9	UPGRADE

602	1	ACRR of ENOC is proposed to be overridden to 4A due yo reasons as specified below which are not covered in the rating model.• Strategic importance of ENOC to Dubai:ENOC is the national oil company of Dubai, owned by the Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), the sovereign wealth fund of Dubai Government. It meets Dubai’s energy needs, by:o supplying aviation fuel at the Dubai Airports, with 55% market shareo operating over 120 retail gasoline and diesel outlets throughout Dubai and Northernemirates, ando by supplying LPG across the Emirateo owning and operating Dubai’s only refinery at Jebel Alio owning 100% stake (through Dragon Oil Plc) in upstream oilfields, with current production of over 140k barrels per day ENOC plays a critical role in Dubai’s economy for its continued growth, and in executing the Emirate’s plan for becoming a world class city. It is highly unlikely that the Governmentof Dubai will allow ENOC to renege on its financial obligations.• Management oversight from the Ruling family:ENOC’s chairman is Shaikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Deputy Ruler of Dubai, and Minister of Finance for UAE. ICD, which has 100% ownership of ENOC, is chaired by Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai and Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE. Board of Directors of ENOC comprise of leading eminent personalities of Dubai. These individuals are involved in providing strategic direction to ENOC, which lay further credence to view ENOC as a vehicle for promoting and aiding growth to Dubai’s economy.• Track record:ENOC has a strong track record in meeting its debt obligations, and in its dealings with banks. This was exhibited when ENOC exited the loss making operation in the bunkering business, which was in JV with the Independent Petroleum Group (IPG) in FY2008. Whileexiting the business, ENOC ensured that the financial obligations of the JV company were paid off and settled as per the terms. ENOC’s reputation amongst the banking community allows it to be one of the most desirable and sought after relationships amongst the Dubai Government related entities, evident by the international, regional and local relationship banks that provide financing to ENOC.These points outlining ENOC’s strategic importance and strong track record are not captured in the ACRR model while arriving at the rating. In addition to these, DBS Dubai and ENOC share a strong relationship. ENOC views DBS as a key relationship bank,especially given its objective of growing in the Asian markets. In line with the account strategy, our objective is to be ENOC’s preferred partner in its growth endeavor, with potential opportunities on M&A advisory and related financing needs in Asia.In view of the above justification, will request your approval to override the ACRR model rating of 4B for ENOC LLC, and retain the existing rating of 4A.”	OV_9	UPGRADE
603	7	As LMT is a Qualified Top Tier WMNC and investment grade rated by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, we request an override to an ACRR of 4A from a CRR of 8A generated by the GLC model. LMT's negative tangible net worth is generated over a history of acquisitions. Nevertheless, the acquired goodwill and intangibles have substantial value as proven by continued generation of cash flow.We request an approval for ACRR override from 8A to 4A based on the following reasons:1. Improved leveraged with Debt to EBITDA at 2.0x in FY2017.  Historically, leverage has been below 3.0x the past four years.2. In FY2017, total revenue increased 8.0% YoY to $51Bn as revenue increased across all business segments.  LMT continues to show growing profitability and strong FCF generation.3.  Total backlog and funded backlog continues to be steady.4. From a peer analysis, an upgrade is warranted based on comparable leverage metrics.  We note that the difference in margins between the competitor set is driven by exposure to non-government products which allows for higher margins, but the benefit of higher margin is weighted on the benefit of long term product cycle.

Its established market leader status in the industry with over 1.2 m CATV subscribers,2.  Strong customer relationship and penetration of its extensive network in its franchise areas,3.  Proprietary technology and network (last mile of pipeline to retail end-subscribers) invested and developed in the broadband service offerings,4.

Strict corporate governance in testing the potential impairment for goodwill on annual basis and the result suggest that there is no sign that any impairment may arise.Based on the above, we assessed that these goodwill assets have enabled CNS a sustainable business and steady cash flow and formed a certain level of entry barrier for brand newcomers to reach such stance and scale if they were to build up the network on their own, and therefore implying the acquisition premium that the acquirer is willing to pay for the business on top of the fair value of physical assets.Peer benchmarking and reference with selected foreign CATV peers like Charter Communications (3rd largest in the US) and Liberty Global (the largest in the UK) is conducted.Even though sales scales of these two companies are larger given the absolute market size of US and the UK, they have similar business nature and represent similar fianncial profile and ratios with Taiwan MSOs as they have negative tangible net worth due to substantial goodwill as well as high net leverage ratio at 4.7x and 6.0x respectively.

The multi-notch downgrade can be explained by the deterioration in current ratio from 1.16x as at 31Dec15 to 0.98x as at 31Dec16 and gearing ratio from 1.93x as at 31Dec15 to 2.58x as at 31Dec16. The deterioration in the ratios was due to a one-off large dividend payout of S$84.8m in 2016, that shrunk Borneo’s cash reserves and equity base. Notwithstanding that, balance sheet health remained satisfactory. We highlight that Borneo’s business performance in FY16 was exceptionally strong, as exhibited by the 29% growth in revenue (S$1.14b) and 7.7% growth in NPAT (S$68.3m). Further, Borneo has consistently been the market leader in Singapore car dealership realm, in terms of sales volume (ie. Toyota ranked #1 in 2014, 2015 and 2017) as well as profit margin.

As a result, the Company remains susceptible to adverse industry and market changes. We note, for informational purposes, that The Walt Disney Company has public mid-Investment Grade debt ratings (A+ Negative and A2 Stable by S&P/Moody’s, respectively), and that such public ratings align with the DBS ACRR of “3”.

618	2	"•	We propose an ACRR 3 for BMW AG unchanged y-o-y. This is a 2-notch override on the CRR produced by the GLC model. The ACRR 3 is supported by: •	Committed liquidity buffer: BMW’s liquidity position is bolstered by the EUR8.0B committed standby credit facility (which following the extension of tenor will mature in July 2023). The syndicate includes 48 banks with participations ranging from EUR68.5M to EUR276M, demonstrating the strong bank support for the Group. Importantly we note that the EUR8.0B facility is a back-stop facility, therefore is not intended to be utilised, thus is a true liquidity buffer.•	Strength of brand: BMW was ranked 13th in Interbrand’s “Best Global Brands 2017” (2016: 11th), making it the 13th most valuable brand globally with a value of USD41.5B (c.EUR35.7B) slightly behind Mercedes-Benz in 9th place. This brand value is not represented on the Group balance sheet.  In fact, the Interbrand assessment of BMW’s brand value is more than 4x the balance sheet value of BMW’s total intangible asset base. This has not been accounted for in the GLC model.•	The Group’s strong geographic diversity which is not factored into the GLC model.•	The consolidated accounts of BMW include both the automotive manufacturing and the financial services activities of the Group. As BMW is a global large corporate with sales well in excess of SGD100m the GLC model is the appropriate model to use in this case. However, we are of the view that the model does not appropriately assess the credit quality of the non-corporate activities of the Group, which account for approximately 26% of 2017 external revenue. One of the main financial services provided by the Group is the provision of financing to customers to enable the purchase of BMW vehicles. These loans to customers are financed through external debt raised mainly through the debt capital markets and financial institutions. This debt is successfully serviced by receivables from customers repaying loans to BMW. The strength of these receivables is demonstrated by the volume of ABS transactions (currently EUR16.9B outstanding) which BMW has transacted in many countries around the globe in recent years. The GLC model has fully taken into account the debt levels at the Group however we do not believe that the model has fully captured the fact that this debt is almost fully matched by the financed receivables. •	The case for an upgrade is further bolstered by the Group’s external ratings: A+ / A1 from S&P and Moody’s respectively. In early 2017 Moody’s upgraded BMW to A1, giving BMW the highest rating of any European automobile manufacturer and the second highest worldwide."	OV_9	UPGRADE

622	1	(2c) Industry Trend:According to Transparency Market Research expects the global home networking device market size to reach USD23bn with 7% CAGR and the unit shipment to grow up to USD1bn with 10% CAGR during 2023 due to home connectivity upgrades.  IoT has been one of the key driving factors in the ICT industry.  According to certain analysts, the connection device volume will potentially reach 40bn units by 2020; moreover, according to estimations by the IDC, by 2020 the market capitalization of IoT will soar to USD1.46tn, with 38% contributd by the manufacturing industry in the Asia Pacific, excluding Japan (APEJ).  IoT continues to bring business opportunities for Smart Home Controls, in which market Sercomm has enhanced its penetration rate in North America and the diversity of Sercomm’s product portfolio, including IP Cameras, Sensors, and smart energy, let Sercomm grow with the uptrend momentum of IoT.  Furthermore, strong momentum in China and robust demand in fiber optic cable and policy support.(3d) Liquidity:Net Sales/Financial Expense ratio largely improved from 508x in FY16 to 654x in FY17, which indicated the borrower's business income is well sufficient to cover its interest expenses.  In addition, the reason for financial support from banks is to optimize its benefit from cash utilization.  As we can see, Sercomm’s debt coverage is quite satisfied.  Furthermore, the net cash position from 2004 to date represents solid liquidity.  Overall, there is no debt repayment concern and Sercomm has had great liquidity for many years.(4a) Company Internal Factors:Sercomm continues to demonstrate its core competence in launching different innovative products, and they are well prepared to take advantage of growing momentum in IoT and Smart Home market.  According to market researchers, SerComm’s FY18 consolidated revenues are expected to grow by 6-14% YoY with improved operating profit margin of 4.3-4.7% based on the following views.  The recovery of fiber in China in 2H17 will likely continue into 2018.  The cable upgrade from DOCSIS 3.0 to 3.1 should stimulate demand for cable gateways.  Furthermore, Sercomm has penetrated multiple new European customers in IAD (integrated access devices), with volume ramp in 2018.  In addition to the increased orders from US enterprises in commercial products, Sercomm has diversified into the Chinese enterprise market, which should further propel growth in 2018.(6a) Exceptionally Good or Bad Management:The following were awarded by Asiamoney to SerComm: “Best Managed Company”, “Best Companies in Asia for Corporate Governance” and “Best for Investor Relations”.  Finance Asia also presented Sercomm with awards for being the “Best Mid-Cap Company” and for having “Best Corporate Governance”.  These awards provided industry wide recognition for Sercomm as a company with exceptional corporate governance and management team.	OV_2C,OV_3D,OV_4A,OV_6A	UPGRADE

625	-2	The GLC model rates Avnet, Inc. at a CRR of 4A, however; we reccommend an override of the GLC rating to 5 due to the following factors:1) Volatile Free Cash Flow (FCF):  Historically, FCF generation has been volatile.  While in FY2017, Avnet generated FCF of $101MM, in FY2016 FCF was negative, while in FY2015 FCF was $184MM.  FCF volatility is primarily driven by working capital usage.2) Distribution is a low margin business with Avnet's EBTIDA margin, as of FY2017, being 4.4%3) Volatility in the semiconductor industry and vunerability to economic cycles.

627	8	As Boeing is a Qualified Top Tier WMNC and investment-grade rated by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, we request an override in the ACRR to “3” from the “8A” generated by the GLC model for the following reasons:• Debt / EBITDA. Strong debt servicing capability and modest leverage is not fully reflected in the GLC model, as Boeing is penalized for its negative tangible net worth as of 12/31/2017. As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt payback appears weak when using Total Debt / Tangible Net Worth as benchmark. However, using Debt / EBITDA as a benchmark reflects meaningfully lower risk, at only 0.9x Debt / EBITDA as of 12/31/2017. Additionally, debt servicing capability is strong, as Boeing generated cash from operations of over $13.3Bn in 2017, and is projected to continue to generate substantial cash flow for the foreseeable future. We view the low leverage and strong cash flow generation as indicative of a “3” rating.• Strength of Brand/Patent. Boeing’s low tangible net worth is primarily due to its substantial goodwill and tangibles. These goodwill and intangibles represent acquisitions as well as patents, licenses and brands. As such, these intangibles continue to have substantial value as proven by the continued cash flow generated by these intangibles.• Committed liquidity buffer. Boeing’s liquidity position is enhanced by the $5.0Bn of availability on its committed revolving credit facilities and existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.0Bn as of 12/31/2017.
