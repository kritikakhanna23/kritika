GC0000054396	4B	6A	Borrower was previously rated '5' under SME PD Model. ACRR was improved to rating of 4B due to strong financial performance relative to GLC population. Notably, co's sales figures continued to grow by 12.9% in the financial period, AR DOH was low at 11 days, and borrowings/net worth is low at 0.07x. However, we note that borrower is the subdealer of Cycle & Carriage (C&C) retailing Mitsubishi & KIA vehicles. As such, there is sole supplier risk since they do not carry any new car stock and are subjected to stocks held by C&C. Furthermore, As a subdealer, co will have limited bandwidth in diversifying the car brands sold, and will be susceptible to market perception of the Mitsubishi &KIA brands. Hence, it is proposed that ACRR be proposed to be notched down to 6A, one down from previous year's rating under GLC model in view of the stale financials.	Company outlook/Brand Strength	Jan-19

GC0000117517	8B	4A	We propose an override of CG's ACRR from 8B to 4A, based on the following key considerations: 1. Conventional financial credit metrics are not fully applicable to the business trust structure. For FY2017, the capital structure of CG comprises bank debt (S$178m), and Qualifying Project Debt Securities (QPDS, S$196m). CG structured as a business trust and hence is able to make distributions to its unitholders in excess of its net profit after tax or even when it records a loss after tax, so long as the distributions are supported by operating cashflow. This suggests that a typical business trust is unlikely to have significant retained earnings which will adversely impact its tangible networth position. In addition, it is not uncommon for business trusts to show accounting losses and negative networth due to: (i) structuring to optimize tax efficiency e.g. using tax deductible instruments such as QPDS as quasi-equity in the capital structure; and (ii) noncash depreciation associated with	miscellaneous	Jan-19

GC0000186000	8B	8A	We are proposing a GLC model override and note that Senoko’s rating has traditionally been penalised by the GLC model owing to its negative tangible networth (S$2.16b of goodwill recorded on its balance sheet post-acquisition from Temasek, similar with Tuas Power and YTL PowerSeraya). CRR 8B/ ACRR 8A is a one-notch downgrade from  last year’s CRR 8B / ACRR 7B. Senoko will also be placed on Watchlist-Red for monthly monitoring (currently Watchlist-Amber) given the shorter runway to refinancing in 2019. This downgrade factors in Senoko’s lower profitability on the back of keen market competition and resultant fine retail margins.	Financial Strengths/Weakness/Concerns	Jan-19

Strong debt servicing capability and modest leverage is not fully reflected in the GLC model, as Boeing is penalized for its negative tangible net worth as of 12/31/2017. As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt payback appears weak when using Total Debt / Tangible Net Worth as benchmark. However, using Debt / EBITDA as a benchmark reflects meaningfully lower risk, at only 0.9x Debt / EBITDA as of 12/31/2017. Additionally, debt servicing capability is strong, as Boeing generated cash from operations of over $13.3Bn in 2017, and is projected to continue to generate substantial cash flow for the foreseeable future.

In addition, the Company continues to stringently control costs and improve profit margins. - COP’s FCF has continued to remain positive at $864MM in 1Q18 and is projected to remain positive with oil and gas prices expected to remain above $60 a barrel in FY18. - Leverage improved to 1.5x at 1Q18 as management has made concerted efforts to reduce total debt.  Leverage of 1.5x (at 03/31/2017) is in line with other major players rated “A” and above.  (Occidental Petroleum - 1.8x, ExxonMobil – 1.2x, Chevron – 1.6x).  Net Debt to EBITDA is better than its peers at 0.9x. - Liquidity remains strong - The Company has maintained substantial available liquidity of over $16Bn in the form of over US$10Bn in cash and equivalents, plus an unfunded committed revolving line of credit totaling $6.0Bn. This is more than sufficient to cover any temporary cash flow shortfalls. - Strong Access to Capital Markets -  Company has maintained substantial capital markets access as exemplified by its continued investment grade debt ratings (A-/Baa1), and public equity that is widely traded on the NYSE with a market value over US$79.10Bn, and even at the bottom of oil prices in Feb 2016, had a market value in excess of US$39Bn.

GC0000395127	6B	7A	We have downgraded the ACRR to 7A to match its peers, which are also rated at 7A. Given that the Borrower TCPL was mainly into palm oil trading in year ending March 31, 2018, we are comparing the company with 2 similar palm oil traders - Just Oil and Acalpo. As per peer group comparison given in page 6 of the memo, we note that TCPL’s sales turnover is lower than Just Oil but higher than Acalpo. However, its gross and net margins are much higher than the 2 companies. The reason could be because the 3 companies are not strictly comparable as TCPL is not a pure palm oil trader. Also it offers credit period to its buyers, which helps it secure higher margins. In terms of networth TCPL is substantially larger than its competitors with over USD 36 M of TNW.Further, the ACRR of the parent of TCPL is also 7A. As such, we have aligned the ACRR of TCPL to 7A.

GC0000393429	8A	3	General Dynamics Corporation (“GD”) is a Qualified Top Tier WMNC with an investment grade rating of A+/A2 by S&P and Moody’s, respectively.  We would like to request an override in the ACRR to “3” from the CRR of “8A” generated by the GLC model for the following reasons:•  Low Leverage - GD’s leverage, measured by Debt/EBITDA, continues to be lower than their industry peers at 1.4x and not fully reflected in the GLC model as GD is severely penalized for it negative tangible net worth.  As a result, balance sheet leverage and debt payback appear weak when using Total Debt/Tangible Net Worth as a benchmark.  Additionally, debt servicing capability is strong, with a ISCR of 41.4x as of 04/01/2018.•  Strength of Brand/Patent - GD’s negative tangible net worth is primarily due to its substantial goodwill and intangibles. These goodwill and intangibles represent acquisitions as well as patents, licenses and brands which continue to have substantial value as proven by the continued cash flow generated by the various segments of the Company. •  Committed liquidity buffer - In addition to cash of $4.3Bn as of 4/01/18, GD’s liquidity position is enhanced by the $5.0Bn of availability on its committed revolving credit facilities.•  The proposed ACRR at 3 is in line with the previously approved ACRR.

GC0000231626	3	6A	Reason for over-ride to an ACRR of 6A:The existing CRR and ACRR for Micron is (respectively) 4B and 6B.  Based on the Company’s most recent financial statements (FYE ending 8/31/2017 and Interim 6 Mos. ending 3/1/2018) OSCA currently generates a CRR of 3, (up two notches from the existing CRR of 4B).  The improved CRR is based primarily on Micron’s strong FY 2017 operating performance and reduced financial leverage, period over period.For the ACRR, we are proposing an ACRR of 6A, up one notch from the existing ACRR of 6B, based on the following:1) The improved state of the industry (particularly in terms of supply), due to the effect of industry consolidation and somewhat less interest in price competition by the remaining industry participants.2) Micron’s success in implementing more permanent manufacturing cost efficiencies, which should leave them in a margin-positive position, even in the face of a 50% contraction of ASPs.3) Micron’s stated intention to further reduce debt over the course of the next 1-5 years.  Micron has demonstrated its ability to generate meaningful levels of Free Cash Flow, complemented by a growing liquidity cushion.  Such improved metrics are expected to assist the Company’s plan to reduce its financial leverage going forward.  Additionally, for informational purposes only, we note that an ACRR of 6A correlates with Micron's external corporate family ratings of BB+ from S&P and Ba1 from Moody's.

GC0000325086	4B	3	"•	We propose an ACRR 3 for BMW AG unchanged y-o-y. This is a 2-notch override on the CRR produced by the GLC model. The ACRR 3 is supported by: •	Committed liquidity buffer: BMW’s liquidity position is bolstered by the EUR8.0B committed standby credit facility (which following the extension of tenor will mature in July 2023). The syndicate includes 48 banks with participations ranging from EUR68.5M to EUR276M, demonstrating the strong bank support for the Group. Importantly we note that the EUR8.0B facility is a back-stop facility, therefore is not intended to be utilised, thus is a true liquidity buffer.•	Strength of brand: BMW was ranked 13th in Interbrand’s “Best Global Brands 2017” (2016: 11th), making it the 13th most valuable brand globally with a value of USD41.5B (c.EUR35.7B) slightly behind Mercedes-Benz in 9th place. This brand value is not represented on the Group balance sheet.  In fact, the Interbrand assessment of BMW’s brand value is more than 4x the balance sheet value of BMW’s total intangible asset base. This has not been accounted for in the GLC model.•	The Group’s strong geographic diversity which is not factored into the GLC model.•	The consolidated accounts of BMW include both the automotive manufacturing and the financial services activities of the Group. As BMW is a global large corporate with sales well in excess of SGD100m the GLC model is the appropriate model to use in this case. However, we are of the view that the model does not appropriately assess the credit quality of the non-corporate activities of the Group, which account for approximately 26% of 2017 external revenue. One of the main financial services provided by the Group is the provision of financing to customers to enable the purchase of BMW vehicles. These loans to customers are financed through external debt raised mainly through the debt capital markets and financial institutions. This debt is successfully serviced by receivables from customers repaying loans to BMW. The st"	Financial Strengths/Weakness	Oct-18

GC0000244690	7B	3	The GLC model places an overemphasis on Tangible Net Worth (TNW). Because of recent acquisitions, IBM had goodwill and intangibles of $40.5Bn, as of 12/31/17. With a book equity value of $17.7 billion, this renders the TNW negative. However, this is not uncommon for large U.S. technology companies, as the industry continues to consolidate. We believe an override to an ACRR of 3 is justified based on the following:• Leverage - IBM has a moderate leverage profile, with Total Debt / Adj. EBITDA and Net Debt / Adj. EBITDA of 2.7x and 2.0x, respectively, as of 12/31/17. • Profitability - IBM has consistently been profitable and generated substantial Adj. EBITDA and NPAT. In 2017, IBM generated Adj. EBITDA and NPAT of $17.1Bn and $5.8Bn, respectively.  NPAT was lower than previous years mainly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which resulted in the Company recognizing a one-time charge of $5.5Bn in FY17.• Liquidity - As of 3/31/18, the Company had ample liquidity of $28.1Bn, including cash and marketable securities of $12.8Bn and undrawn existing and proposed revolvers.• Management - IBM has a highly regarded management team with significant years of experience in the technology industry.

GC0000184805	6A	5	CLC's CRR stood at 6A based on 2016/17 financials. However, we propose to maintain CLC's ACRR at 5 in view of the following considerations: •   CLC's gearing ratio deteriorated to 1.19x from 1.01x in FY16, which adversely affected rating model's financial ratio percentile. However, increase in debt was only temporary, given CLC borrowed more ST debt at year-end 2017 to pile up raw material at lower price level. Coupled with CLC's early repayment of Chung Loong’s syndication outstanding in Aprl’18, the group's total debt level should normalize by 2Q18. •   Business outlook for CLC is expected to remain stable this year, given its leading position in Taiwan industrial paper market (48% market share), and improving profitability in its China operations, backed by continuous capacity consolidation and better product mix. Profitability is expected to at least remain stable, supported by solid global paper price in 2018, on top of one-off disposal gain recognition (RMB520mn or NT$2.4bn eqv.) from selling SHCL, its paper mill in Shanghai.	miscellaneous	Oct-18
